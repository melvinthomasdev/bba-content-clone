# BB Academy Content

This repository contains the format in which the course data should be stored, if you choose to keep the source of your neetoCourse courses as a GitHub repository.

You can fork this repository and use it as a template for your courses.

## Running the code locally

Running the code locally is extremely difficult since it requires setting up OAuth and other things.
The best strategy is to send a PR and look at the review apps created by neetoDeploy

## Repository structure to connect a course to GitHub

Refer to [this documentation](https://neetocoursehelp.neetokb.com/p/a-b68add58).

## Style guide

Refer to [this documentation](https://bigbinary-academy.neetokb.com/p/a-8bd6eedd).

## Miscellaneous

Single Action --> Design the chapter in such a way that the student has to perform a single action at the end.
If it feels like there should be more than actions, split them into two chapters.
Practice exercise chapters can be standalone chapters and they can have multiple action points.

No Scroll --> (Try to) Write only so much that the text and the exercise can be completely displayed on a single 1080p screen. Scrolling should be avoided.

Focus on practical chapters first, and theory the last. --> E.g. the introductory section in JS is to be created later after we have created and launched a practical version of the course.

Mobile Design/mobile screen considerations --> Not our concern right now. This will be charted once the web is over.
