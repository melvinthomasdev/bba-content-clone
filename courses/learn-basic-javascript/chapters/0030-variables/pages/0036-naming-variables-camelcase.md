For variables containing multiple
words, we write all the words
together without spaces.

To distinguish each word,
we capitalize the first alphabet
of all the words,
except for the first word.
This is known as **camelCase**.

Let's take a look at another example:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const lengthOfBox = 120;
console.log(lengthOfBox);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example given above,
we use `lengthOfBox`
without spaces between the words
because `length of box`
is not a valid name.
Variable names cannot contain spaces.

We will be naming variables
using the camelCase
in all the JavaScript courses.
Here are some other examples
of names using camelCase -
`firstName`, `lastName`,
`temperatureInCelsius`,
`fruitsWithRedColor`.

### Note:
In JavaScript, camelCase has become
a widely accepted way of variable
naming. Although this is not defined
as a rule, it has evolved as a community
practice.
