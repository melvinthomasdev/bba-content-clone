Given are two variables
`message` and `welcome`,
both have strings as
values.

If the values of `message`
and `welcome` are equal
log Boolean `true` to the
console and Boolean `false`
if they are not equal.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput" showSolution="false">
<code>
const message = "Welcome to the world of Chocolate.";
const welcome = "welcome to the world of chocolate.";
</code>
<solution>
const message = "Welcome to the world of Chocolate.";
const welcome = "welcome to the world of chocolate.";

console.log(message === welcome);
</solution>
</codeblock>

Fix the below code with
best practices learnt so

<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput" showSolution="false">
<code>
let firstName = "Anand";
const age = 22;

firstName = "Sojan";
age = 20;

a = "India";
b = "12kg";
c = "50kg";
c = "51kg";
d = 3.14159
</code>
<solution>
let firstName = "Anand";
let age = 22;

firstName = "Sojan";
age = 20;

let a = "India";
let b = "12kg";
let c = "50kg";
let c = "51kg";
let d = 3.14159;
</solution>
