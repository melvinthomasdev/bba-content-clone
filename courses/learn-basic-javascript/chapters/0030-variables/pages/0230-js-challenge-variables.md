In the code provided below,
we have two variables `message`
and
`welcome`,
both containing string values.

Update the code below to carry out
the following actions:
- Verify the equality of both variables
and log the result to the console.
- Store the result of multiplying
`3` and `16` in a variable named
`result` and log it to the console.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput" showSolution="false">
<code>
const message = "Welcome to the world of Chocolate.";
const welcome = "welcome to the world of chocolate.";
// Write your code here
</code>
<solution>
const message = "Welcome to the world of Chocolate.";
const welcome = "welcome to the world of chocolate.";
// Write your code here
const result = 3 * 16;

console.log(message === welcome);
console.log(result);
</solution>
</codeblock>
