We can join strings using the `+` operator.
And we can store the joined result into a new
variable of our choice.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const firstName = "Sam";
const lastName = "Smith";
const fullName = firstName + lastName;

console.log(fullName);
</code>
</codeblock>
