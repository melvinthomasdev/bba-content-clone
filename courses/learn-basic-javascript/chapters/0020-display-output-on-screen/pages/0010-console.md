In JavaScript, content just doesn't
appear on the screen by itself.
We need to use `console.log()`
to make it visible on a special
screen called **console**.

Click on **Run Code** button
given below to
display **I love ice cream**.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
console.log("I love ice cream");
</code>
</codeblock>

Change **ice cream** in the editor
given above to a food of
your choice
and
then click on 'Run Code'.
