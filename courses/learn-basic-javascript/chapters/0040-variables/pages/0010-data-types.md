Different programming languages
work with different sets of data types.
JavaScript also has a set of data types
it can work with.
Consider the following example:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
console.log("Hello World!");
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example given above,
we get the output **"Hello World"**
because we pass the data - `"Hello World!"`
inside `console.log()`.

This data type that
consists of a bunch of characters
inside double quotes
is known as the **String** data type.

Similarly, **Number** is also
a data type supported by JavaScript:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
console.log(12345);
</code>
</codeblock>

Data types in JavaScript can be
categorized into two:

1. Primitive data types like
   **String**, **Number**, **Boolean**,
   **null**, **undefined**,
   **BigInt**, and **Symbol**.

2. Composite data types like
   **Object**, **Array**, **Date**,
   and **Map**.

We will be learning about these data types
in the upcoming sections.
