The values `true` and `false`
are known as **Boolean** values.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const isAdmin = true;
console.log(isAdmin);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the above example,
we store a boolean value `true`
in a variable `isAdmin`.

It is a good practice to name
variables that store boolean
values like a question.
In the above example,
The name `isAdmin` asks the question -
"Is the user an admin or not?".
`isAdmin = true` answers the question -
"Yes, the user is an admin".
