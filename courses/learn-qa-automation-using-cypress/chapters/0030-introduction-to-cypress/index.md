### What is Cypress?

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. It
addresses key issues that both developers and QA engineers face when testing
modern applications.

Cypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can
do that no other testing framework can:

- **Time Travel:** Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over
  commands in the
  [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log)
  to see exactly what happened at each step.

- **Debuggability:**
  [Debug directly](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging) from
  familiar tools like Developer Tools. The readable errors and stack traces make
  debugging lightning fast.

- **Automatic Waiting:** Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress
  automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more
  async hell.

- **Spies, Stubs, and Clocks:** Verify and control the behavior of functions,
  server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing
  is right at your fingertips.

- **Network Traffic Control:** Easily
  [control, stub, and test edge cases](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests)
  without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.

- **Consistent Results:** The Cypress architecture doesnâ€™t use Selenium or
  WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are
  flake-free.

- **Screenshots and Videos:** View screenshots taken automatically on failure,
  or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI. Record to
  [Cypress Cloud](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) to store
  them with your test results for zero-configuration debugging.

- **Cross browser Testing:** Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers
  (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous
  Integration pipeline.

- **Smart Orchestration:** Once you're set up to record to Cypress Cloud, easily
  parallelize your test suite and rerun failed specs first for tight feedback
  loops.

- **Flake Detection:** Discover and diagnose unreliable tests with Cypress
  Cloud's
  [Flaky test management](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).
