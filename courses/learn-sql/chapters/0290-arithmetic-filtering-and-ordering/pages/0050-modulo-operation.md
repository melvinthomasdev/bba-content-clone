We all understand division.

```
9 / 4 = 2
```

In this case, the remainder will be **1**.
How do we get the remainder.
To get remainder use `%`.

```
9 % 2 = 1
```

In the computer science the "modulo operation" gives us the remainder.
`%` is used to denote "Modulo operation".
`%` gives us remainder.

Let's see some more examples.

```
9 % 5 = 4
6 % 5 = 1
8 % 5 = 3
5 % 5 = 0
```

## Is the number even or odd

`%` can be used to find if a number is even or odd.
If the remainder is 1 then it is an odd number.
If the remainder is 0 then it is an even number.

```
11 % 2 = 1
12 % 2 = 0
```
