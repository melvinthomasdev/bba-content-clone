<h2 id="soft-cheese">Soft cheese</h2>
<p>Cream cheeses are not matured. Brie and Neufchâtel are soft-type cheeses that mature for no more than a month. Neufchâtel is a soft cheese which can be sold after 10 days of maturation.</p>

<h2 id="semi-soft-cheese">Semi-soft cheese</h2>
<p>Semi-soft cheeses, and the sub-group Monastery cheeses, have a high moisture content and tend to be mild-tasting. Well-known varieties include Havarti, Munster, Port Salut and Butterkäse.</p>

<h2 id="medium-hard-cheese">Medium-hard cheese</h2>
<p>Cheeses that range in texture from semi-soft to firm include Swiss-style cheeses such as Emmental and Gruyère. The same bacteria that give such cheeses their eyes also contribute to their aromatic and sharp flavours. Other semi-soft to firm cheeses include Gouda, Edam, Jarlsberg, Cantal, and Kashkaval/Cașcaval. Cheeses of this type are ideal for melting and are often served on toast for quick snacks or simple meals.</p>

<h2 id="semi-hard-cheese">Semi-hard cheese</h2>
<p>Harder cheeses have a lower moisture content than softer cheeses. They are generally packed into moulds under more pressure and aged for a longer time than the soft cheeses. Cheeses that are classified as semi-hard to hard include the familiar Cheddar, originating in the village of Cheddar in England but now used as a generic term for this style of cheese, of which varieties are imitated worldwide and are marketed by strength or the length of time they have been aged. Cheddar is one of a family of semi-hard or hard cheeses (including Cheshire and Gloucester), whose curd is cut, gently heated, piled, and stirred before being pressed into forms. Colby and Monterey Jack are similar but milder cheeses; their curd is rinsed before it is pressed, washing away some acidity and calcium. A similar curd-washing takes place when making the Dutch cheeses Edam and Gouda.</p>

<h2 id="hard-cheese">Hard cheese</h2>
<p>Hard cheeses—grating cheeses such as Grana Padano, Parmesan or Pecorino—are quite firmly packed into large forms and aged for months or years.</p>
