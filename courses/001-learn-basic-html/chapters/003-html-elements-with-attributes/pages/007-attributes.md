An HTML element can have optional **attributes**. An attribute is used to set the behaviour of an HTML element. It has two parts, a **name** and a **value**, and is added within the opening tag of an element.

For example, let us look at the **title** attribute. The title attribute is used to set the text which is displayed when the mouse is hovered over an HTML element.

In the code example given below, we add this attribute to an `<h1>` element with the value as **The web loves HTML**. So, take your mouse cursor over the heading text in the result and within a second, you'll see the **title** attribute in action.

<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<h1 title="The web loves HTML">On the internet, HTML is everywhere</h1>
</code>
</Editor>

The `img` element uses the `src` attribute to find where the image is located.

<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<img src="view-from-a-balcony.png" />
</code>
</Editor>

Similarly, the `a` element uses the `href` attribute to point to the destination link.

<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</a>
</code>
</Editor>

As we learn about more elements, we'll see more of these attributes and understand their usage.
