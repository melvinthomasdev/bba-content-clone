An HTML document is made up of different HTML **elements**. Each HTML element typically has three parts:

1. Opening tag
2. Content
3. Closing tag

<a/> <!-- Empty tag to end list -->

Let us take the example of an `<h1>` element:

<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</code>
</Editor>

The `<h1>` at the beginning is called the **opening tag**, the 'Hello, World!' text is the **content** and the `</h1>` at the end is called the **closing tag**.

<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<br />
<h1>This is another heading</h1>
</code>
</Editor>
