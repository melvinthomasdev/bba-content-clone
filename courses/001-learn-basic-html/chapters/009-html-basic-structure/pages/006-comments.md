Comments are great! Comments can help explain your work to other coders and even to your future self.

Comments do not get shown in the actual webpage. Although your comments can contain anything you want, yet it is recommended that you keep them precise and helpful.

For writing a comment use the syntax: `<!-- text -->`
<Editor lang="html">
<code>
<!--
This is a multi-line comment.
This will not show in the result.
-->

<!-- Single Line comment: This will also not be visible in the result. -->

<!-- I should remember to update this message next year. -->
<h1>2020 will be the best year yet!</h1>
</code>
</Editor>

If you feel your HTML is a bit confusing to read, just put in a comment there as shown above. This way, when you come back to the code after some time, things will still make sense.
