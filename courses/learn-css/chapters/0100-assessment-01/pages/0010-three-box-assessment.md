Using the CSS knowledge that you have gained
so far, attempt to build
the following:

A bunch of rectangles that can be resized.
Ensure that they don't look bad
on any screen size.

On mobile screens, the text should not flow
out of the rectangles, and on large TV screens,
there should not be too much empty space inside
the rectangles.
