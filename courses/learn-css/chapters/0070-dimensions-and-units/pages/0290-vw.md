When length is specified using `vw`,
it is calculated based on the window width,
also known as viewport width.

Viewport is the visible part of a screen.
In the example given below, the viewport is
the rectangular window given below the
code editor and, the `div` covers **50%**
of the width of `100vw` and has the same height.

`1vw` is `1%` of the window width.
So, `100vw` is equivalent to the window width.

<codeblock language="css" type="lesson">
<code>
<panel language="html">
<div>
  Occupies 50% width of the window, with same height.
</div>
</panel>
<panel language="css">
div {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 50vw;
  background-color: beige;
}
</panel>
</code>
</codeblock>
