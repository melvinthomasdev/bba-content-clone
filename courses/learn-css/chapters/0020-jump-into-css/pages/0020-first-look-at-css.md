With CSS, you can add a background color
to your page,
change the color or size of your text
and much more:

<codeblock language="css" type="lesson">
<code>
<panel language="html">
<h1>
  Solar System
</h1>
<p>
  The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
</p>
</panel>
<panel language="css">
body {
  background-color: orange;
  color: black;
}
</panel>
</code>
</codeblock>

Try changing the background color to `yellow`.
