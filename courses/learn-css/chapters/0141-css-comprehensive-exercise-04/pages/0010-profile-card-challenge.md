Build the below **profile card** using the
CSS knowledge that you have gained
so far.

Use the image link: [https://ucarecdn.com/f4c2bf2e-8279-499b-998f-d90427ab1fd1/](https://ucarecdn.com/f4c2bf2e-8279-499b-998f-d90427ab1fd1/) to get the image of the dog. We have added an image element in the below codeblock with the same link.

You will need to use this [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Master%20Builder&preview.text_type=custom&query=lato) for the title.
