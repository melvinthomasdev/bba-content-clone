API User : **422 should be used when the data is syntactically correct but
semantically incorrect.**

API builder : You sure love fancy words.

API builder : Last time you talked about data being **syntactically correct.**

API builder : And now you are talking about **semantically incorrect.** Why
can’t you speak simple english.

API User : “Semantically” simply means business wise.

API User : It’s possible that the payload sent by the client is valid JSON but
it is not complying with the business rules.

API User : For example in order to create a user you need name. If the payload
does not provide name then it is an example of data being valid JSON data but
“business-wise” it is not valid.

API User : So in other words the payload is “syntactically correct” but
“semantically incorrect”.

API builder : That’s good to know. I will fix the code.
