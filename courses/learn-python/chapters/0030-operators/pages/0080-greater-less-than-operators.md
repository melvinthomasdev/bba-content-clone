## The greater than operator
The greater than operator `>` is used to check if a value is greater than the other.
It checks if the value to the left of the operator is greater than the value to the right of the operator.

For example:

- `5 > 3` will result in a boolean `True` since 5 is **greater** than 3.
- `3 > 5` will result in a boolean `False` since 3 is **not greater** than 5.

<code>
print(3 > 5)

## The less than operator
The less than operator `<` is used to check if a value is lesser than the other.
It checks if the value to the left of the operator is lesser than the value to the right of the operator.

For example:
5 < 3 will result in a boolean `False` since 5 is **not lesser** than 3.
3 < 5 will result in a boolean `True` since 3 is **lesser** than 5.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(3 < 5)
</code>
</codeblock>

## The greater/less than or equal to operator
We can also use the greater than / less than operator with an equality operator to check if a value is greater/lesser or equal to its right hand side value.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(3 >= 3)
print(3 <= 3)
</code>
