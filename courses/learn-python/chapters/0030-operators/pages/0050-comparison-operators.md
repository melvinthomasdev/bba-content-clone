Comparison Operators are used to compare two values. The operation returns a **Boolean** result which is either `True` or `False`. First among the comparison operators is the equality/in-equality operator.

## The equality operator
This operator is used to compare any two values in Python. If they are the same a boolean `True` is returned else `False` is returned.

## The Inequality operator
As the name suggests, the inequality operator is basically the inverse of the equality operator. It is used to ensure that two values do not match. It will return a boolean `True` if the two values don't match and a boolean `false` if they do.
