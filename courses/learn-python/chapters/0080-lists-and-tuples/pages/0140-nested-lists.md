We can store a list within a list in Python. These are called **Nested Lists**. For example, if we want to create 3 teams, with 3 people in each team, we could store them in the following way within a nested list.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
teams = [
  ["Sharukh", "Aamir", "Salman"],
  ["Akshay", "Ajay", "Sunil"],
  ["Katrina", "Bobby", "Amitabh"]
]

print(teams)
</code>
</codeblock>

In the above example `teams` is a nested list containing 3 lists.
