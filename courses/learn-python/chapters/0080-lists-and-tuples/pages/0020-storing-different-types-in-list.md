It is not necessary for a List to have values of the same data type. They can hold values of different data types too.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
person = ["Alex", 24, 69.5, "USA"]
print(person)
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example above we store the Name(String), Age(Integer), Weight(Float), and Country(String) of a person. These values have different data types which are accepted in a Python List.
