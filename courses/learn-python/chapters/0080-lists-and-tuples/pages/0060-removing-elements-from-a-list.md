Removing an element from a list is similar to appending one. 
We can use the `remove()` method to remove an element from a list. 

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
list_of_animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'sheep', 'horse']
print(list_of_animals)

list_of_animals.remove('sheep')
print(list_of_animals)
</code>
</codeblock>
