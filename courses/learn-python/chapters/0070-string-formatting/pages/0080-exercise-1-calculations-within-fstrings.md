Given the previous leap year, calculate the next leap year (previous leap year + 4) and print the result in the string **The next leap year is `year`**. Do this calculation within the f-string.

<codeblock language="python" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput">
<code>
# Calculate the next leap year within the F-string and print it to the screen
# Expected output: The next leap year is `year`

previous_leap_year = 2020
</code>

<solution>
# Calculate the next leap year within the F-string and print it to the screen
# Expected output: The next leap year is `year`

previous_leap_year = 2020
print(f"The next leap year is {previous_leap_year + 4}")
</solution>
