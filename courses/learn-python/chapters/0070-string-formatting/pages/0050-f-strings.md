The latest and recommended method to format strings is using F-Strings. F-Strings are declared using `f""` . We can add our variables directly within the text and Python will join them with the string for us.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
name = "Akash"
age = 29
print(f"My name is {name}. And my age is {age}")
</code>
</codeblock>
