Python provides a number of utilities and storage methods that can help us store our data in the most effective way. Many of these utilities are available in the collections module.

Let's first import the collections module within our code to use these methods.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
import collections
print(collections)
</code>
</codeblock>

A module is a file, or folder of python files that must be explicitly imported to be used.

Now that our collections module has been imported, let's go ahead and use some of the methods within it.
