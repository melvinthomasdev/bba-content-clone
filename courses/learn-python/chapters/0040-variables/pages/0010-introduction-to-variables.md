Let's try out variables by declaring a variable and printing its value in our program.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
number_of_shirts = 5
print(number_of_shirts)
</code>
</codeblock>

The example above introduces the variable `number_of_shirts`.
We can also name our variable `shirt_count` or `num_of_shirts` or `shirts_num` or any desired name.
`number_of_shirts` is an arbitrary name we have given to our variable.
The `number_of_shirts` is assigned the value `5` using the `=` operator.

We can modify a variable's value or use it with operators as follows.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
number_of_shirts = 5
print(number_of_shirts + 5)
print(number_of_shirts * 4)
</code>
</codeblock>
