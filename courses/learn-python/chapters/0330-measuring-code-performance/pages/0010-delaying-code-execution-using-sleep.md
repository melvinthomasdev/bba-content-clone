Python provides a small utility function called `sleep()` within the time module that allows us to suspend the execution of our code for a given number of seconds.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
import time

print("Started running code.")
print("Waiting for 5 seconds.")
time.sleep(5)
print("Finished executing code")
</code>
</codeblock>

`sleep()` takes in the number of seconds to suspend the program before executing the next time.
