Python provides us a short way of using the if/else statement on a single line. This method is used to quickly return values based on the result of the condition.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
day = ""
to_do = "Go to sleep" if day == "Sunday" else "Go to work"
print(to_do)
</code>
