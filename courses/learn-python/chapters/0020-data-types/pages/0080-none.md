The `None` keyword denotes a special data type in Python which represents an empty value. Values that are `None` are recognized as values having no specific state. They are just the default representation of a state that has not been initialized or assigned anything yet.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(type(None))
</code>
</codeblock>

We compare types using the `is` keyword.

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(type("") is None)
print(type(3) is None)
print(True is None)
print(type(2.3) is None)
print(None is None)
</code>
