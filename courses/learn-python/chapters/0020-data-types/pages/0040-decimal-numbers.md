The numbers `1`, `2` and `3` are whole numbers and are represented as **Integers** in Python.

Decimal numbers are represented with a `.` between the numbers dividing the number into its *whole part* and *decimal part*.

Decimal numbers are known as *Floats* in Python. For example `5.333` is a decimal represented by the `float` data type in Python.

We can also perform all arithmetic operations we performed on integers on floats.

Addition:

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(3.2 + 4.9)
</code>
</codeblock>

Subtraction:

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(2.4 - 1.2)
</code>
</codeblock>


We can also combine **Integers** and **Floats** while performing arithmetic operations:

Multiplication:

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(6 * 9.1)
</code>
</codeblock>

Division:

<codeblock language="python" type="lesson">
<code>
print(25/5.2)
</code>
</codeblock>
