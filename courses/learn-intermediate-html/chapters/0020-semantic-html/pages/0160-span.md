Imagine we have a piece of writing,
such as a story or a paragraph.

Occasionally, we might want to draw
attention to or separate a particular
part of that text, like a word or
a sentence, to make it more noticeable
compared to the rest of the text.

The `<span></span>` tag acts like a
special marker that we can place around
that specific part of the sentence or word.
It allows us to apply a different style
to that marked portion, such as changing
its color, font, or background.

Let us take look at an example:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<panel language="html">
<p>This is how we use <span>span</span>.</p>
</panel>
<panel language="css">
span {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</panel>
</code>
</codeblock>

As we can see from the code above
the `<span>` tag by itself doesn't
have any inherent functionality
or effect.

However, we can utilize CSS properties
to modify its appearance either by
applying styles directly to the tag
or by using class or ID selectors.

The `<span>` tag is an inline element,
which means it doesn't create line breaks
and can be seamlessly placed within
a line of text without disturbing the
flow of the surrounding content.
