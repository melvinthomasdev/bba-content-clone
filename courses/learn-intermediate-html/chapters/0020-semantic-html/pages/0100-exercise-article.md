    <h2>DIY - Build an airplane</h2>
    <p>
        Model airplanes are difficult to build. But with the right mindset,
		we can achieve this in a couple of days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flying model aircraft are generally controlled through one of three methods:
		<ul>
			<li>Free flight (F/F) model aircraft are uncontrolled other than by control surfaces that must be preset before flight, and must have a high degree of natural stability. Most free flying models are either unpowered gliders or rubber powered. These pre-date manned flight.</li>
			<li>Control line (C/L) model aircraft use strings or wires to tether the model to a central pivot, either held by hand or to a pole. The aircraft then flies in circles around that point, secured by one cable, while a second provides pitch control through a connection to the elevator. Some use a third cable to control a throttle. There are many competition categories. Speed flying is divided into classes based on engine displacement. Class 'D' 60 size speed planes can easily reach speeds well in excess of 150 mph (240 km/h).</li>
			<li>Radio-controlled aircraft have a controller who operates a transmitter which sends signals to a receiver in the model to actuate servos which adjust the model's flight controls similarly to a full sized aircraft. Traditionally, the radio signal directly controlled servos, however, modern examples often use flight control computers to stabilize the model or even to fly it autonomously. This is particularly the case with quadcopters. Rudimentary flight controllers were first introduced in model helicopters, with standalone electronic gyroscopes used stabilise the tail rotor control. Much like quadcopters, this has now extended to all flight controls.</li>

	<h2>Building something from scratch is tough! How to seek support?</h2>
    <p>
        It is extremely tough to build something by yourself. The process is tedious, and can be frustrating for even the most experienced ones. How to find the right help is an important skill in this field.
