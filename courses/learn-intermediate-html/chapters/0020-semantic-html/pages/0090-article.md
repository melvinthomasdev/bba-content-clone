An `article` element stores
the content that can be grouped
together.

For example, a heading about
a news item, an image about that
piece of news and paragraph tags with
all the text for that news can be
grouped inside an `article` tag.

Look at the following example:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<article>
    <h2>A new sun rises for the endangered frog species</h2>
    <p>
        A sudden increase in funding for the efforts to sustain the endangered frog species of the world has brought new life to the whole program.
        <a href = "#">Read More</a>
    </p>
    <img src = "https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2019/06/10163715/Poison-dart-frogs-are-able-to-develop-a-mental-map.jpg" width = "200px" />
</article>
</code>
</codeblock>

In the above example, we have
multiple elements like a heading,
an image and a paragraph. All of these
work together as a single piece of
information.
