The `<dialog>` element is used
to create a pop-up window,
which is called a **dialog box**.

By default, the dialog box is
hidden and not displayed.
To make the dialog box visible,
we need to add an `open`
attribute to the `<dialog>` element.

Let us have a look at an example:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<dialog open>
  <p>This is a basic dialog box.</p>
</dialog>
</code>
</codeblock>

We will learn about how to control
the `<dialog>` element using
JavaScript in the next lesson.
