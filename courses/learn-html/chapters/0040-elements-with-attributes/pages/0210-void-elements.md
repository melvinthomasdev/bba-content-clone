In HTML, as a rule, every element
is required to have both an
opening and a closing tag.
However, there are exceptions
to this rule.

Certain HTML elements are self-closing
elements and they do not require
a closing tag. These elements are
called **Void Elements**.

The `/` is optional for void elements.
Some developers use `/` while writing
the void elements, but in this course,
the void elements will be written
without the `/`.

Let us have a look at some examples
of void elements:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<h1>Void Elements Example</h1>
<p>Some text here.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
</code>
</codeblock>

Since there is no closing tag,
no content can be added between
the opening and closing tags.
