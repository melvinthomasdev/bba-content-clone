The basic structure of every HTML document is as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

- A `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration
- An `<html>` element, which is the root HTML element that holds all the other elements.
- A `<head>` element, which contains information about the document.
- A `<body>` element, which contains the actual content displayed in the browser.
