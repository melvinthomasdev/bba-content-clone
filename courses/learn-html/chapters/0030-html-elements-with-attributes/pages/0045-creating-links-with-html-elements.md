We can transform various elements
into clickable links simply by
enclosing them within the `<a>` tag.

By wrapping different elements
in the `<a>` tag,
we can create interactive links that
allow users to navigate to other web
pages or resources with ease.

Let us have a look at some examples of
commonly used elements that can be
turned into links:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<!-- Using Text as a Link -->

<!-- Using p tag as a link -->
