The `img` tag has something important called `alt`. We use alt in an img tag to provide a description of the image. This is particularly useful in situations when our image is not properly loaded on the screen.

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b9721aee-1c09-4d0c-9bcb-8969afe2751e/-/resize/400x/" alt="The view from a balcony">
<img src="broken-link.jpg" alt="The view from a plane">
</code>
</codeblock>

As seen in the second image above, when the image doesn't load on the screen, the added alt text is displayed.

There could be many reasons why an image is not loaded. Maybe your internet is not good, or the link that you have used for the image is not correct.

The `alt` is also used by screen readers to explain the image to visually impaired people.
