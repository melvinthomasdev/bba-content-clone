The `main` tag is used to
hold all our major content
in the web page.

Take a look at the following example:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <img src="#">
      <h1>5 Reasons why HTML is the King!</h1>
      <p>In this study, we'll list 10 reasons why HTML is one of the most important languages invented on the web.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML is forgiving</li>
        <li>HTML is easy to understand</li>
        <li>HTML powers the whole web</li>
        <li>HTML can be easily configured with other languages like JavaScript, and Python</li>
        <li>An HTML only website can load really fast</li>
      </ol>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
</codeblock>

As you can see, we have
included all our content inside the
`main` tag inside the `body`. This is
the use of the `main` tag, simply
to hold all our important stuff.

Then, the question comes up: "Why don't we
simply keep all the content inside the
body tag?"

Well, because we want to organize everything
neatly!

Look at the example given below:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li>
        <li><a href="/career">Career</a></li>
      </ul>
    </header>
    <main>
      <img src="#" >
      <h1>5 Reasons why HTML is the King!</h1>
      <p>In this study, we'll list 10 reasons why HTML is one of the most important languages invented on the web.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML is forgiving</li>
        <li>HTML is easy to understand</li>
        <li>HTML powers the whole web</li>
        <li>HTML can be easily configured with other languages like JavaScript, and Python</li>
        <li>An HTML only website can load really fast</li>
      </ol>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
</codeblock>

Here, our code becomes so easy to read.
Our navigation bar which stays at the top
of the website is in the `header` and all
our major content in in the `main` tag. Both of
these tags are inside the `body` tag.
