The elements `<h1>` through `<h6>` are used to display headings.

`<h1>` is the most important heading.

`<h2>` is less important than h1, but more important than any other text.

This way, we have six different types of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

Normally, the size of the heading shows its importance. See the example given below:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<h1>Hello BigBinary Academy</h1>
<h2>Hello BigBinary Academy</h2>
<h3>Hello BigBinary Academy</h3>
<h6>Hello BigBinary Academy</h6>
</code>
</codeblock>
