The `<br>` element is used to
introduce a line break in your text.
Unlike most HTML elements, it does
not require a closing tag.

By using the `<br>` element,
you can force the text to start
on a new line without creating
a new paragraph.
This is particularly useful when
you want to display information
in different lines.

Any content following the `<br>`
tag will be displayed as a new line
on the screen.

Let us have a look at an example:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<h2>Address written with a p tag</h2>
<p>128, Najafgarh Road, Nangloi, New Delhi</p>
<h2>Address written with br tags in a p tag</h2>
<p>128, Najafgarh Road,<br> Nangloi, <br> New Delhi</p>
</code>
</codeblock>
