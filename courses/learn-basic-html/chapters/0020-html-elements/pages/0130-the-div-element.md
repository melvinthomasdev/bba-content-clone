Look at this code given below:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<h2>First Div</h2>
  <h4>Let's talk about HTML</h4>
  <p>This part of our HTML is about HTML.</p>
  <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Badge_128.png">
  <h2>Second Div</h2>
  <h4>Let's talk about Javascript</h4>
  <p>This part of our HTML is about Javascript.</p>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg/120px-Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg.png">
</code>
</codeblock>

If you look at the code, it is hard to read and understand.

Now, let's use the `<div>` element as shown in the code given below:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<div>
  <h2>First Div</h2>
  <h4>Let's talk about HTML</h4>
  <p>This part of our HTML is about HTML.</p>
  <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Badge_128.png">
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Second Div</h2>
  <h4>Let's talk about Javascript</h4>
  <p>This part of our HTML is about Javascript.</p>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg/120px-Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg.png">
</div>
</code>
</codeblock>

Nothing changed in the output.
But one look at the code, and you can see
that everything looks organized.

The `<div>` element is used to create a
section in an HTML document.

It is a box in which you can hold a certain
part of your content. You can group HTML tags,
text, or any kind of content together in a `div`.
Since, it is simply holding your content, you'll
see no change in the output, but your code is
now more organized.
