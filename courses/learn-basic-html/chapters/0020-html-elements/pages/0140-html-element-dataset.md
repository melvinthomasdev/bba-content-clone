The **dataset** is a read-only
property that allows us to set
and get custom data attributes,
`data-*`, on our HTML elements.

All **dataset** attribute names
should begin with `data-`.

Let us have a look at an example
of adding custom data attribute
in HTML:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<h1 id="fruit" data-fruit-name="orange">Orange</h1>
</code>
</codeblock>

As we can see, in the above
code we are defining `data`,
the data property is called
`fruit-name` and it's value
is `orange`.

The usage of the same will be
discussed further in the
context of **HTML DOM**.
