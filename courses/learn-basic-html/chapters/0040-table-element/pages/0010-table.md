The `<table>` element is used to display data in a table consisting of rows and columns.

The following elements are used to arrange the data within a `<table>` element:

- `<tr>` - It is used to add a table row.
- `<td>` - It is used to add information in a table row.

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Oliver</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>Male</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>Female</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</code>
</codeblock>

Please note that the table element in Academy will look good because we have 
worked behind the scenes to add some style to it. Outside the Academy, unless you 
work on table styles, your tables will look very different from the ones you see 
here.
