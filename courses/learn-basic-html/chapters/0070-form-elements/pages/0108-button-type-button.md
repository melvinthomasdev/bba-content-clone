A `<button>` element with
its type attribute set
as `button` will create
just a simple clickable
button which does nothing.

Let us have a look at an example:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<form>
  <label>Number of bottles recycled:</label>
  <br>
  <input type="number" min="0" />
  <br>

  <button type="button">Button</button>
</form>
</code>
</codeblock>
