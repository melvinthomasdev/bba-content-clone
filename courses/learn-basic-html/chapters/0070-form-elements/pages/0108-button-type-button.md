A `<button>` element with
its type attribute set as
`button` creates a simple
clickable button that performs
no action on its own.

Let us have a look at an example:
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<form>
  <label>Number of bottles recycled:</label>
  <br>
  <input type="number" min="0" />
  <br>

  <button type="button">Button</button>
</form>
</code>
</codeblock>

To make this type of button
interactive,
**JavaScript** is required.

We will learn more about adding
interactivity to HTML elements
in our JavaScript course on
[HTML DOM](https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/learn-htmldom/).
