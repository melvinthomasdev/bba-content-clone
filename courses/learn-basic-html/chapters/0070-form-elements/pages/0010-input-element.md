There are many HTML form elements. Let's look at some of the important ones:

The `<input>` element accepts data from the user. Its functioning depends on the value of its _type_ attribute.

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<form>
  <input type="text">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
</code>
</codeblock>

In the above example, the `<input type="text">` element will accept text values, and `<input type="submit">` will be used to submit the form data.
