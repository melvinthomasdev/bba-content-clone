There is another important thing to note about
the `img` tags. You'll notice that the `img` tag
uses `alt` as shown below:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/b9721aee-1c09-4d0c-9bcb-8969afe2751e/-/resize/400x/" alt="The view from a balcony">
</code>
</codeblock>

We use `alt` in an `img` tag to provide
a description of the image. This is particularly
useful in situations when our image is
not properly loaded on the screen. Also, the `alt`
text is used by screen readers to explain
the image to visually impaired people.
