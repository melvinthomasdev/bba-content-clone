The `<a>` element is used to create a link to a web page. Here are some examples:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>

<h2>Bears</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">Let's read about Bears!</a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Giant Pandas are interesting too!</a>
</p>

As you can see, the `<a>` element contains `href`.
When we click the link, the `href` identifies the
web page to which the browser will now take us.

We can add any element within `<a>` tags to
make it work like a link. Some commonly used
elements are images, text, and divs or spans.
