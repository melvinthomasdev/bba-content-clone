In HTML, an element can have
multiple attributes, which are
additional information provided
within the element's start tag.

Let us have a look at an example
of an image tag using multiple
attributes:

<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
<code>
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/6b775097-118c-4cd9-80a2-a5b144e3aa86/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg-/resize/400x/" alt="JavaScript Logo">
</code>
</codeblock>

Here, we have added two attributes
**src** and **alt** to the `img` tag.
