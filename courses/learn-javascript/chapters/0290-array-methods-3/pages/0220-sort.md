The `sort()` method
sorts an array.
By default,
the method sorts
the array in the ascending order.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2];
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers);
</code>
</codeblock>

The sorting happens according
to the order in which the string versions
of the array elements
will appear in a dictionary.

Note that the `sort` method
directly mutates the `numbers` array.
We don't have to assign the sorted array.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2, 11];
numbers.sort();
console.log(numbers);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example given above,
because the `sort` method
looks at the array elements as strings,
**"11"** comes before **"2"** in
the code given below.

We can supply a function as an
argument to the `sort()` method.
The function can be used
to change the sort order.
The function will be invoked on
every two elements in the array.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2, 11];
const sortNumbers = (a, b) => {
  if (a > b) return 1;

  if (a === b) return 0;

  return -1; // when a < b
}

numbers.sort(sortNumbers);
console.log(numbers);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example above,
the function `sortNumbers` is invoked
by passing two elements of `numbers`
as arguments.
Based on the value returned
by the function,
`sort()` decides the positions
of the two elements.

- If the return value is **greater than 0**
  it means that `a` should come after `b`.

- If the return value is **lesser than 0**
  it means that `a` should come before `b`.

- If the return value is **equal to 0**
  it means that the positions of `a` and `b`
  need not be changed.
