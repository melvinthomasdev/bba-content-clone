We have a function **doubleNumber** 
that doubles any number that we 
provide to it and then puts it 
on the screen.

Run it once and ensure that it 
uses **32** as the value.

Then, run it again, and this time 
run it so that it shows the double of 
**111** on the screen.

<solution>
// Write your code below this line

const doubleNumber = (number) => {
  console.log(number * 2);
}

doubleNumber(32);
doubleNumber(111);
