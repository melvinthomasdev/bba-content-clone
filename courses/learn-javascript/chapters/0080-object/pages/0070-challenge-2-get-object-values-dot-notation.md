Create a variable
`countries`, value
of which is an object with
each key representing a
country and value will be the
primary language spoken.

Properties of the object are
as follows:

| Key         | Value      |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| germany     | "German"   |
| spain       | "Spanish"  |
| france      | "French"   |
| japan       | "Japanese" |
| italy       | "Italian"  |


Later, log the value of `france`
and `japan` to the console
using dot notation.
