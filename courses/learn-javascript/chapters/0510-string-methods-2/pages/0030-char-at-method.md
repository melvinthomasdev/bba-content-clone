We can use the `charAt` method
to get the character at a particular index
in the string.

In the example given below,
we are accessing the second character of the string.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const userName = "Sam Smith";
console.log(userName.charAt(1));
</code>
</codeblock>
