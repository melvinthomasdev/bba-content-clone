An expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value.

Consider the following example:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
console.log(20 + 30);

const length = 1000;
console.log(length / 100);

console.log(typeof "Hello World");
</code>
</codeblock>

In the above example:

- `20 + 30` is an expression.
  `+` is the operator.
  `23` and `45` are operands. It resolved to the value `50`.

- `length = 1000` is an expression.
  `=` is the operator.
  `length` and `1000` are operands.

- `length / 100` is an expression.
  `/` is the operator.
  `length` and `100` are operands.

- `typeof "Hello World"` is an expression.
  `typeof` is the operator.
  `"Hello World"` is the operand.

  

Note that, operators that require two operands are called **binary operators**.
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `=` are all binary operators.

Operators that require only one operand are called **unary operators**.
`typeof` is a unary operator.

The operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are called **arithmetic operators** and are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers.
