We can declare multiple variables in a single line
by separating them with commas.

```js
let length, width, height;
```

We can combine the variable declaration and initialization
into a single line.

```js
const length = 120, width = 60, height = 40;
```

Here, the variables `length`, `width` and `height` were
declared and initial values were assigned in a single line.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const length = 120, width = 60, height = 40;

console.log("The values of Length, Height and Width are:")

console.log(length, height, width);
</code>
</codeblock>
