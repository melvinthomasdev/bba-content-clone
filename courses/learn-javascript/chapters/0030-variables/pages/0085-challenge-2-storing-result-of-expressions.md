We have provided below the results of the scores of Harry, Ron, and Sam in a test.
Calculate and store the average marks scored by all three in a variable.
Also, print it to the console.

For example:

```js
Input: (markScoredByHarry = 10), (markScoredByRon = 11), (markScoredBySam = 9);

Output: 10;
```

<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput">
<code>
const markScoredByHarry = 7;
const markScoredByRon = 7;
const markScoredBySam = 11;
// Write your code here
</code>
<solution>
const markScoredByHarry = 7;
const markScoredByRon = 7;
const markScoredBySam = 11;

const average = (markScoredByHarry + markScoredByRon + markScoredBySam)/3;

console.log(average);

</solution>
