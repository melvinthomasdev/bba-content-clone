In JavaScript, you can create different types of information or data such as a phone number, your name, or even a list of your favorite football players. Different types of these data that JavaScript or any other programming language offers can be called data-types.

Consider the following example:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const wish = "Hello World"
console.log(wish);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example given above,
we are assigning a value **"Hello World"**
to a variable named `wish`.

This value that
consists of a bunch of characters
inside double quotes
is known as the **String** data type.

Similarly, **Number** is also
a data type supported by JavaScript:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const speed = 51;
console.log(speed);
</code>
</codeblock>
