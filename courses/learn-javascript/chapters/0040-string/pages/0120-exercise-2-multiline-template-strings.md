Create a variable `verse`.

Using template string, write the verse
in the below format. Each line should
be on a separate line within
the template string.

```md
"Death is certain for one who has been born,
and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died.
Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable."

— Lord Krishna
```

Log the value of `verse` to the console:
<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput">
<code>

</code>

<solution>
const verse = `
  "Death is certain for one who has been born,
  and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died.
  Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable."

  — Lord Krishna
`;

console.log(verse);
</solution>
</codeblock>
