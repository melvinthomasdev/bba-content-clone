Update the console log
statements to display the
values accordingly:
`Employee ID: [employeeIdNumber]`
`Name: [employeeIdNumber]`
`Department: [department]`
`Full-Time: [isFullTime]`

<codeblock language="javascript" type="exercise" testMode="fixedInput">
<code>
let employeeName = "Eve Smith";
let employeeIdNumber = "012345";
let department = "Marketing";
let isFullTime = true;

console.log();
console.log();
console.log();
console.log();
</code>

<solution>
let employeeName = "Eve Smith";
let employeeIdNumber = "012345";
let department = "Marketing";
let isFullTime = true;

console.log(`Employee ID: ${employeeIdNumber}`);
console.log(`Name: ${employeeName}`);
console.log(`Department: ${department}`);
console.log(`Full-time: ${isFullTime}`);
</solution>
</codeblock>
