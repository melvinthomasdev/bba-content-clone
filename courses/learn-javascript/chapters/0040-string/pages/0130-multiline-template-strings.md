We can have **multiple lines**
in a template string,
as shown in the example given below:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const itemList = `Fruits:
  Apple
  Mango
  Banana
  Orange
`;

console.log(itemList);
</code>
</codeblock>

Looking at all these benefits of using backticks `` ` ``,
we will continue to use it across the Academy.
