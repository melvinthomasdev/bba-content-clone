Any data type whose elements
can be accessed in a sequential manner
is an **Iterable**.
In other words,
the elements of an **Iterable**,
have a particular order
and
we can traverse through each element,
one after the other,
in that order.

**Arrays** are iterables because,
the elements of an array
have a particular order,
represented by their index.

**Objects**, on the other hand,
are not iterables.
The properties of an object
do not have a particular order.

Other examples of iterables
are **Maps** and **Sets**.
