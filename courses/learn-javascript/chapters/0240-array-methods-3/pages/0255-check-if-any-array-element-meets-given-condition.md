The `.some()` method allows us to check
if at least one element in an array passes
a specified test.

Syntax:
```js
array.some(callback(element, index, array));
```
- callback: A function with the test to be applied on each element of the array.
- element: The current element being processed in the array.
- index - optional: The index of the current element being processed.
- array - optional: The array `.some()` was called upon.

`.some()` returns **true** if the callback function
returns **true** for at least one element,
otherwise, it returns **false**.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const numberSet1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const numberSet2 = [3, 5, 7, 9];

const hasEvenNumber = numberSet1.some(num => num % 2 === 0);
const hasZero = numberSet2.some(num => num === 0);
console.log(hasEvenNumber); // Output: true
console.log(hasZero); // Output: false
</code>
</codeblock>

In this example, we have passed a function
that checks if at least one number in the
`numberSet1` array is even to `.some()`.

Since **2** is an even number in `numberSet1` array,
the callback function returns **true** once
for it
and
thus `.some()` method returns **true**
which is stored as a value for `hasEvenNumber`
variable.

Similarly, there is no zero in `numberSet2`
array, which is why the callback function returns
**false** every single time
and
`.some()` method returns **false** which is
stored as a value for `hasZero` variable.
