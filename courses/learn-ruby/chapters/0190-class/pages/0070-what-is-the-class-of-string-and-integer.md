Just for fun, let's ask
what is the class of
"Hello, BigBinary Academy".

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
hello = "Hello BigBinary Academy"

puts hello.class

</code>
</codeblock>

The result is `String`.
And that is correct.
`hello` is an instance
of the `String` class.

Now, let's try the same
thing on an integer.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
age = 18

puts age.class

</code>
</codeblock>

The output is `Integer`.
It means all the integers are
instances of the class `Integer`.
