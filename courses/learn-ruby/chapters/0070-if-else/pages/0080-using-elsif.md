We have seen `if else`.
If we have more than
one condition, we can also
use `elsif`.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
score = 63

if score > 80
  puts "You got A grade."
elsif score > 60
  puts "You got B grade"
else
  puts "You did not get A grade. Good luck next time."
end
</code>
</codeblock>

Notice that the first
one is `if` and then
we have `elsif`.

However, the very last
one is `else`.
