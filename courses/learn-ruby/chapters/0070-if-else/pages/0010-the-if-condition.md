The `if` condition is used to do
something when the given
condition is true.

Look at the example given below.
When the condition `food == pizza` is
true, we print to the screen **You
like pizza.**.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
food = "pizza"

if food == "pizza"
  puts "You like pizza."
end
</code>
</codeblock>
