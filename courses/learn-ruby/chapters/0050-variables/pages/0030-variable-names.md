In Ruby, variable names
must start with an underscore
or with a lowercase letter.
`full_name`, `get_age`,
and `fixed_price` are good
examples of Ruby variable
naming.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
# Recommended style in Ruby
first_name = "John"

# Not Recommended in Ruby
firstName = "John"
</code>
</codeblock>
