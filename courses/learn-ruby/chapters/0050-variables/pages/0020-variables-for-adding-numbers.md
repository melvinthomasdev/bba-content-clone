In this example, we have
two variables `number1`
and
`number2`.

We are adding these two variables
and
storing the result in a third
variable called `result`.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
number1 = 10
number2 = 20
result = number1 + number2

sentence = "Result of adding 10 and 20 is " + result.to_s

puts sentence
</code>
</codeblock>
