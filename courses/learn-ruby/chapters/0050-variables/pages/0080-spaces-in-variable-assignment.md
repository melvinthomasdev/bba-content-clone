Let's look at two styles of variable assignment.
The first style has no spaces before and after `=`.
The second style has one space before and after `=`.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
# style 1
first_name="John Smith"
puts first_name

# style 2
last_name = "John Smith"
puts last_name
</code>
</codeblock>

In programming, we prefer
the second style because
it makes it easier to read code.

For computers, there is no difference
between the first style and the second style.

For computers, it is the same code.
