We have an array called `items`.
It has 4 items.

```
items = ["ice cream", "chocolate", "movies", "beaches"]
```

If we want to get the second
item from the array,
then we need to say `items[1]`.
In computer science, the
first position is 0 and not 1.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
items = ["ice cream", "chocolate", "movies", "beaches"]

puts items[1]
</code>
</codeblock>

If we want the third item,
then we need to say `items[2]`.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
items = ["ice cream", "chocolate", "movies", "beaches"]

puts items[2]
</code>
</codeblock>

For the 4th item, we need to look for `[3]`.
You can see the pattern.
It means that the first
item of an array starts at
zero and not at one.
