In this example, two strings
are combined to make a
single bigger string.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
name = "John Smith"
greeting_style = "Hello"

greeting = greeting_style + " " + name
puts greeting
</code>
</codeblock>

Joining two or more strings or any other data types together is called **Concatenation** in Computer Science, so the above operation can also be stated as `"concatenate these two strings to make a single bigger string"`.
