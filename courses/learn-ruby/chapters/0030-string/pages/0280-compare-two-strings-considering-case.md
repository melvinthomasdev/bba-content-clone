In Ruby, the `<=>` operator, also known as the 
spaceship operator, facilitates case-inclusive 
string comparisons.

If `string1` and `string2` are the two 
strings you want to compare, the result
will be an integer that indicates the 
relationship between the two strings.

- If the result is 0, it indicates that both strings are equal.
- If the result is a positive number, it signifies that `string1` comes after `string2` in a case-sensitive dictionary order.
- If the result is a negative number, it means `string1` precedes `string2` in a case-sensitive dictionary order.
- If the result is `nil` it means that the two are incomparable.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "HELLO"

result = string1 <=> string2
puts result
</code>
</codeblock>

While `casecmp` specifically targets string 
comparison and is case-insensitive, the `<=>` 
operator is a more versatile method capable of 
handling different data types and considers case in 
its comparison.
