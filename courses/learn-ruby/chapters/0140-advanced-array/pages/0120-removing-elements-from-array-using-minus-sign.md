Ruby uses the `-` sign to
subtract or remove items
from an array.

<codeblock language="ruby" type="lesson">
<code>
array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
array2 = array1 - [2,3]
puts array1
puts array2
</code>
</codeblock>

The `-` does not
change the original array.
A new array is created
after removing the specific
elements from the array.
