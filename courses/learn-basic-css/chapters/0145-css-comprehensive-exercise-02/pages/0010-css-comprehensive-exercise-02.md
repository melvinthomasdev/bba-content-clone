Build the below **profile card** using the
CSS knowledge that you have gained
so far.

Use the image link: [https://ucarecdn.com/cdabb55b-931a-49fc-8f69-4339c3fc2607/](https://ucarecdn.com/cdabb55b-931a-49fc-8f69-4339c3fc2607/) to get the image of the dog. We have added an image element in the below codeblock with the same link.

<image>dog-card.gif</image>

You can use the below codeblock to create the challenge:

<codeblock language="css" type="lesson">
<code>
<panel language="html" >
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/cdabb55b-931a-49fc-8f69-4339c3fc2607/" width="400">
</panel>
<panel language="css">
</panel>
</code>
</codeblock>
