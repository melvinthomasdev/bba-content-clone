CSS knowledge that you have gained
so far.

Use the image link: [https://ucarecdn.com/cdabb55b-931a-49fc-8f69-4339c3fc2607/](https://ucarecdn.com/cdabb55b-931a-49fc-8f69-4339c3fc2607/) to get the image of the dog. We have added an image element in the below codeblock with the same link.

You will need to use this [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Master%20Builder&preview.text_type=custom&query=lato) for the title.
