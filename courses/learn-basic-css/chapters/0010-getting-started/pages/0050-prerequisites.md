You need to know **HTML**
before you begin with **CSS**.

HTML is the language
that describes the structure
of a web page,
while CSS
gives the look and feel to it.

If you are not familiar with HTML,
get started with our [Learn Basic HTML](https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/learn-basic-html/)
course.
