HEX color value is a mix of **Red**, **Green**, **Blue** color values. The colour code uses the hexadecimal number range from **00** to **ff** to represent the different intensities.

Look at the code given below:

<codeblock language="css" type="lesson">
<code>
<panel language="html">
<h1>
  Web Design
</h1>
<p id="one">
  Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
</p>
<p id="two">
  The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization.
</p>
</panel>
<panel language="css">
h1 {
  /* Orange */
  color: #ffa500;
}
#one {
  /* Gray */
  color: #808080;
}
#two {
  /* Black background */
  background-color: #000000;
  /* White text */
  color: #ffffff;
}
</panel>
</code>
</codeblock>

The Hexadecimal syntax is **#rrggbb**, with red, green and blue colour intensities.

In the example given above, `#ffa500` is the colour for the `h1` element's text. Here, **ff** represents the intensity of red, **a5** represents green intensity and **00** is the intensity for blue colour. Together, these give us the **orange** colour.
