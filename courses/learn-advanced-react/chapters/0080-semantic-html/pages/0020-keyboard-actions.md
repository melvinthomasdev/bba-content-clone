By using the correct semantic HTML elements we can make use of built-in keyboard interactivity features.

The most commonly used tags are:
- `<a>` tag for making links. We can select the link using the `Tab` key and then open it using `Return` key. We can open the link in a new tab using `Cmd + Shift + Return`. The Chrome, Edge, and Brave browser support this shortcut.
- `<button>` tag for making buttons. We can select the button using the `Tab` key. Then we can click the button using the `Space` or `Return` key.
- `<select>` tag for adding dropdowns. We can use the `Tab` or `Shift` key to go to the next and previous options in the dropdown. We can use the `Space` or `Return` key to select an option.
- `<input>` and `<textarea>` can be used to add input fields. We can select them using the `Tab` key.

Since the alternative is to add your event listeners, we highly recommend using semantic HTML tags like the one shown above.
