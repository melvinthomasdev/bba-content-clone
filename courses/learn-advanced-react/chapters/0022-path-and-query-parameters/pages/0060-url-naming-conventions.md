1. URLs that open a page should use the `kebab-case`.
Doing so helps in increasing the SEO score of your website as these URLs usually appear in the browser address bar and search results.
For example, `https://example.com/user-profile` should open the user profile page.

2. API endpoints should use the `snake_case` over `kebab-case`.
For example, `https://example.com/api/user/:id/friends_list` fetches the friends list for a user.

3. Try and keep URLs concise
URLs that open pages should be as short as possible allowing people to easily read, understand and share them with others.
URLs in browsers get truncated at 74 characters so keeping them under that limit allows users to double-check the URL if they need to.

4. Use a 301 redirect when changing a URL
The old URL may still be used by users who've saved it and may be led to a dead page, use a 301 to redirect them.
Also, with a 301 redirect, google transfers ranking from the old to the new URL rather than considering them as separate pages.
