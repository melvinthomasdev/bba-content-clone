The `if else` condition helps
us decide between two choices
of action.

When the
given condition is true, we perform
one set of actions. On the other hand,
when the given condition is false, we
do something else.

<code>
food = "pizza"

if food == "pizza"
  puts "You like pizza"
else
  puts "you do not like pizza"
end
</code>

In the example given below,
we have changed food to **soup**.
Notice that this time, the `else`
condition message will be printed.

<code>
food = "soup"

if food == "pizza"
  puts "You like pizza"
else
  puts "you do not like pizza"
