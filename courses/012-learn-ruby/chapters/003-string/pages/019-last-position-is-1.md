If zero is the first position,
then what's the last position?
Answer is **-1**.

We can use **-1** to find the
last letter of the string **hello**.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
string = "hello"
puts string[-1]
</code>
</Editor>

What about next to last?
For that, we can use **-2**.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
string = "hello"
puts string[-2]
</code>
</Editor>
