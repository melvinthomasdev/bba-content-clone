In the programming world,
concatenation means adding
two items.

We can use `+` to concatenate
two arrays.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
numbers1 = [1,2,3,4]
numbers2 = [5,6]

all_numbers = numbers1 + numbers2
puts all_numbers
</code>
</Editor>

In this case, `number1`
and
`number2` did not change at all.

A new array was created
by concatenating the two arrays.

Contrast this with
[push](https://academy.bigbinary.com/learn-ruby/pages/use-push-to-add-an-item-to-an-array)
which changes the original array.
