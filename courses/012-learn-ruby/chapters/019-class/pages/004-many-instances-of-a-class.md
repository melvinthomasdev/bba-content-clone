What's the point of a **Carmaker**,
if it is going to make only one car?
Using **Carmaker**, we can produce
many cars:

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
class Carmaker
end

car1 = Carmaker.new
car2 = Carmaker.new
red_car = Carmaker.new
sports_car = Carmaker.new

puts car1
puts car2
puts red_car
puts sports_car
</code>
</Editor>

Don't worry about the output.
We will discuss the output later.
