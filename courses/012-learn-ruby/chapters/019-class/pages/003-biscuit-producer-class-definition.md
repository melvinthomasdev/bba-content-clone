A Biscuit producer produces **biscuit**.
Let's create a class
called `Biscuitproducer`.

```
class Biscuitproducer
end
```

So far, we have used `Carmaker` and `Coffeemaker`.
Now, let's use `Biscuitproducer`.
The class name does not really matter.
The important thing is that the
class name must start with
a capital letter.

Now let's make a biscuit.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
class Biscuitproducer
end

biscuit1 = Biscuitproducer.new
</code>
</Editor>

In this case, `biscuit1` is
an instance of the class
`Biscuitproducer`.

### Let's go over class and instance one last time

A class is like a maker,
builder or producer.
An instance is what is
made by using `new`.
Here, **biscuit1** is an
instance of the class
**Biscuitproducer**.
