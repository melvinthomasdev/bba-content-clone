To repeat something, Ruby provides
us with `times`. We can use the `do end`
block with it as shown below:

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
10.times do
  puts "I love superman"
end
</code>
</Editor>

In the above example, we want
to print the same statement 10 times.
You can see that `times` is a
much simpler way to do this compared
to loops or anything else.
