In programming, we use variables all the time.
We have already used variables before.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
name = "John Smith"
intro = "My name is " + name
puts intro
</code>
</Editor>

In this example given above, `name` is a `variable`.
We are assigning the value of
`John Smith` to the variable `name`.
`intro` is also a variable
to which a value is being assigned.

Variables can be re-used
and
the values can be reassigned.

<Editor lang="ruby">
<code>
name = "John"
puts name

name = "Mary"
puts name

name = "Eve"
puts name
</code>
</Editor>

In this case given above,
we are using the same
variable `name`,
but we changed its value
three times.
