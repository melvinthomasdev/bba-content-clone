The concepts introduced in this course
are not commonly used
and
in some cases,
are considered bad practices.

For example, this course contains
a section on `Loops`.
Array methods like `map`, `reduce` and `filter`
are preferred over loops in almost all cases.
It is also considered a bad practice
to use loops
unless you come across a situation
where there is no other way
but to use loops.

**Similarly, all concepts introduced
in this course should only be used
if there comes a situation
where there is no other way
but to use them.**
