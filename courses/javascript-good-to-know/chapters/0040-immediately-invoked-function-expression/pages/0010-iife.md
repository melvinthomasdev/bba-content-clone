Sometimes, we want to execute
a function as soon as it is defined.
For these purposes, we can use **IIFE**
which is an Immediately Invoked
Function Expression.

The variables declared inside the IIFE
cannot be accessed from outside the IIFE.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
(() => {
  const message = "Hello, I am Sam Smith";
  console.log(message);
})();
</code>
</codeblock>

Using traditional function definition,
an IIFE would like this:

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
(function() {
  const message = "Hello, I am Sam Smith";
  console.log(message);
})();
</code>
</codeblock>

You can also execute the traditional function expression
as shown in the example below.
The location of the executing parentheses
does not change the output.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
(function() {
  const message = "Hello, I am Sam Smith";
  console.log(message);
}());
</code>
</codeblock>

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
are not commonly used.
They should only be used if
there is a specific reason to use them.
