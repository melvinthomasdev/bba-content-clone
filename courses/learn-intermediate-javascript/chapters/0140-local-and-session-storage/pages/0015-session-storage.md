**sessionStorage** is a web storage object
for storing key/value pairs in the browser.
The stored data is only retained as
long as the webpage is open.

If you close the browser tab or window,
the stored information disappears,
but it survives a page refresh.


To view **LocalStorage** or **SessionStorage** in your browser:

   - Chrome and Brave: Go to **Developer tools** > **Application** tab.

   - Firefox and Safari: Go to **Developer tools** > **Storage** tab.
