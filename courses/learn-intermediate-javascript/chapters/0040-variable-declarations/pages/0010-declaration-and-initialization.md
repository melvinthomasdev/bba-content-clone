It is important to note the difference
between **declaration** and **initialization**.
In the above example,
`let length` is a declaration.
We are only creating or declaring
a variable `length`.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson">
<code>
const length = 123;
console.log(length);
</code>
</codeblock>

In the example given above,
`const length = 123`
is an initialization,
because we are not only
declaring the variable `length`,
we are also assigning it an initial value
or in other words,
initializing the variable with `123`.
