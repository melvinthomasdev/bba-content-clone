## What is Playwright

Playwright is an open-source framework for automating and testing web browsers. Playwright provides a set of APIs that allow developers to interact with web pages, emulate user actions, and perform end-to-end testing.

Some of the features offered by Playwright includes:

- **Cross-Browser Support:** Playwright supports automated testing across various web browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Playwright can also instantiate multiple browser instances simultaneously, allowing us to run tests concurrently across multiple browsers.

- **Multiple pages and contexts:** Playwright allows us to create multiple browser pages and contexts, which are isolated environments that can have different cookies, local storage, and permissions. This enables us to test scenarios like multi-user interactions, authentication, and privacy.

- **Mobile emulation:** Playwright allows us to emulate different devices and screen sizes, enabling us to test how our web application behaves on various mobile devices.

- **Request interception:** Playwright can intercept and modify network requests and responses, which can be useful for mocking API calls, testing error handling, and measuring performance.

- **Screenshots and videos:** Playwright can capture screenshots and videos of the browser pages, which can help us debug and document our tests.

- **Code generation:** Playwright can generate code snippets for our actions in the browser, which can help us bootstrap our tests and learn the Playwright API.

- **Multiple tabs:** Playwright facilitates the development of intricate testing scenarios that extend across multiple tabs.

- **Trace viewer:** It is a GUI tool that helps us explore recorded Playwright traces after the script has ran. Traces are a great way for debugging our tests when they fail on CI.
