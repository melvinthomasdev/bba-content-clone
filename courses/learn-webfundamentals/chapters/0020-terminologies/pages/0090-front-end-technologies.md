We learnt what front-end means in the last chapter. Front-end engineering or front-end development refers to **building the part of the application which is presented to the user.**

The front-end of a web application is built using three main technologies. **HTML, CSS and Javascript**. All the web applications' front-end is built using a combination of these technologies. There are other tools/frameworks that are built on top of these technologies. We'll get to that soon. First, let's take a look at these three technologies.

### **HTML**

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the primary language that the web understands. When you load a website, an HTML file is loaded into the browser. This HTML file contains what we see on the page. HTML uses tags to denote different elements such as lists, headings, paragraphs etc.

### **CSS**

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, helps in making your website look pretty. You can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of your website however you want them to look. You can even create animations and shapes with CSS!

### **JavaScript**

JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. With Javascript you can add interactivity to your website such as changing the content in response to user inputs.

Notice how the suggestions under the search bar changes according to your search inputs? This is achieved by using Javascript! It gives us enormous flexibility in building applications of various scales. From simple todo applications to complex analytical applications, Javascript can do it all!

## Front-end frameworks

Web frameworks are set of tools and resources that helps in building and deploying web applications. They help in making the developers' life simpler by taking care of some stuff behind-the-scenes. It's a little vague to start off with but we'll learn more as we go deeper.

Just like the technologies, frameworks are also classified into front-end and back-end frameworks.
