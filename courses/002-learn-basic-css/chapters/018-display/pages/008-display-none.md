The `display` property has another value `none` which makes the element completely disappear:

<Editor lang="css">
<code>
<panel lang="html">
<span id="span1">You cannot see me</span>
<span id="span2">You can see me</span>
</panel>
<panel lang="css">
#span1 {
  display: none;
}
</panel>
</code>
</Editor>
