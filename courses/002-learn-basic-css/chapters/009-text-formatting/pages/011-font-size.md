We can modify the size of any text
using the `font-size` property.

<Editor lang="css">
<code>
<panel lang="html">
<h1>The Solar System</h1>
<p>
  The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
</p>
</panel>
<panel lang="css">
h1 {
  font-size: 2.4em;
}
p {
  font-size: 120%;
}
</panel>
</code>
</Editor>

Relative values are used more often in choosing font-sizes because they can easily help create a relationship between all the different font sizes.
