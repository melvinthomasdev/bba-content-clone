Take a look at the example given below:

<Editor lang="css">
<code>
<panel lang="html">
<h1>
  Solar System
</h1>
<p>
  The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
</p>
</panel>
<panel lang="css">
body {
  background-color: beige;
}
h1 {
  color: darkgreen;
}
p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
</panel>
</code>
</Editor>

Here, `background-color`, `color` and 
`font-size` are the **Properties**
that we want to change.
While, `beige`, `darkgreen`, 
`blue`, `18px` are the **Values**
that we can give to these properties.
