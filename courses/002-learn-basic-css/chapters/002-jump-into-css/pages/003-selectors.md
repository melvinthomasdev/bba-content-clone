Take a look at the code given below:

<Editor lang="css">
<code>
<panel lang="html">
<h1>
  Solar System
</h1>
<p>
  The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.
</p>
</panel>
<panel lang="css">
body {
  background-color: beige;
}
h1 {
  color: darkgreen;
}
p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
</panel>
</code>
</Editor>

To select the HTML elements
that we want to style,
we need **selectors**.
In the above example, we used
`body`, `h1` and `p` as
the **Selectors**.
