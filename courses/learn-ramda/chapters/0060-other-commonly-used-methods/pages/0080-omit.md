The `omit` function is used to omit specified keys from an object.

For example take below object that contains details of a person.

```js
const person = {
  id: 101,
  name: "John Doe",
  address: "23rd street, California",
  occupation: "Lawyer",
};
```

I want to remove `address` and `occupation` from person details before I send it backend because we don't need it.
To do it we can do as below.

```js
delete person.address;
delete person.occupation;
await fetch("person/update", { person });
console.log(person); // {id: 101, name: "John Doe"}
```

When we do as above, person object also get mutated, so we need to take shallow copy before doing it. so updated
code looks like this.

```js
const personCopy = { ...person };
delete personCopy.address;
delete personCopy.occupation;
await fetch("person/update", { person: personCopy });
```

Now if you use `omit` from Ramda, the above code can be done like below.

```js
await fetch("person/update", {
  person: omit(["address", "occupation"], person),
});
```
