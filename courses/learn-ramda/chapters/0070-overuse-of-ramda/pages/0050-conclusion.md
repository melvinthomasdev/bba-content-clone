Ramda is very powerful and helps us in a lot of use cases. But, it is still a tool that helps make our code easier to read and write. We can decide where and where not to use it. There will be lots of cases where Ramda just makes the code unreadable as we have seen.

We need to strike an optimal balance between Ramda and vanilla JS for our code to be readable. We can make use of all the Ramda functions we have learned till now and even use them mixed inside vanilla JS as we have seen in some examples to leverage the full power of Ramda.

We can also go through the definition of all the functions we have learned till now on the [Ramda docs](https://ramdajs.com/docs/) as well as learn about more functions, and run the examples and code on the [Ramda REPL](https://ramdajs.com/repl/).
