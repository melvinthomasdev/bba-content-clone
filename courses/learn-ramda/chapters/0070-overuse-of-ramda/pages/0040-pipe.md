In the following `user` object, we need a new key called `contactDetails` which is of the form "`user.number` `user.email`". This would seem like a good place to make use of the pipe function.
```js
const user = {
  firstName: 'Oliver',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  number: '9677182390',
  email: 'oliver@example.com',
};

const createContactDetails = pipe(
  props(["number", "email"]),
  join(" "),
  objOf("contactDetails")
);

console.log(createContactDetails(user)); //=> { contactDetails: "9677182390 oliver@example.com" }
```

We select the required properties using `props`, join them together and create an object from it with `objOf`. `objOf` is a Ramda function that takes in a key and a value and creates an object from it: `objOf(key, value)` returns `{ key: value }`.

The next step is to merge it into `user`. We can use `mergeLeft` or `mergeRight` as follows:
```js
const updatedUser = mergeRight(user, createContactDetails(user));
```

This does look good, but it works only for the above `user` object. How would we reuse this for any input object? We would need to pass the object as a parameter to this function. We also cannot curry it since `user` object is used twice. It can be written as follows:
```js
const updateUserWithContactDetails = user => mergeRight(user, createContactDetails(user));

console.log(updateUserWithContactDetails(user));
/*
{
  firstName: 'Oliver',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  number: '9677182390',
  email: 'oliver@example.com',
  contactDetails: "9677182390 oliver@example.com"
}
*/
```

Now, we can make it fully point-free and curry the data using more Ramda functions. But, let us stop this exercise here and look at how we can do it using vanilla JS.
```js
const updateUserWithContactDetails = user => ({
  ...user,
  contactDetails: [user.number, user.email].join(' ')
});

// Or with template strings
const updateUserWithContactDetails = user => ({
  ...user,
  contactDetails: `${user.number} ${user.email}`
});

console.log(updateUserWithContactDetails(user));
/*
{
  firstName: 'Oliver',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  number: '9677182390',
  email: 'oliver@example.com',
  contactDetails: "9677182390 oliver@example.com"
}
*/
```

As you can see, vanilla JS is perfectly readable. We did not have to go through the entire thinking process in Ramda. We saw a part of the requirement that would have been great for the pipe function and decided to use Ramda. This made it complicated for the complete requirement.

We should always try looking at vanilla JS and how readable it would look before thinking of using Ramda in our code.
