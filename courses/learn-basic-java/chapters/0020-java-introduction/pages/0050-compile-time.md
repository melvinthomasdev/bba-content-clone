# Compiler
***Role of a compiler usually is to take entire source code file and translate it into machine readable format (0s and 1s).***

- Role of a compiler in **Java** is to convert entire source code file, not directly to machine code, but into something known as `Byte Code`.

- Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable machine code.
- The instructions or source code written using high-level language is required to get converted to machine code for a computer to understand
- During compile time, the source code is translated to a byte code like from `.java` to `.class`.
- During compile time the compiler checks for the syntax, semantic, and type of the code.
