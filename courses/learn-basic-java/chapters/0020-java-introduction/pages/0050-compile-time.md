  Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable machine code.
  The instructions or source code written using high-level language is required to get converted to machine code for a computer to understand. During compile time, the source code is translated to a byte code like from .java to .class. During compile time the compiler checks for the syntax, semantic, and type of the code.
