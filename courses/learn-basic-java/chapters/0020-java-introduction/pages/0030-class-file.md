  </h1>

    Need for Class File
  </h1>
  <p>
    As we know, java file cannot be executed directly by the system as this is source
    code written in `Human Readable` format, which cannot be understood by the system.
    In Java, '.java' file is usually produced by a Java compiler from Java programming
    language source files line by line to '.class' file which contains Byte code.
