    <b>J.D.K</b>(JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT):
    <p>
      It consists of Java Runtime environment plus tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications. JDK is required to build and run Java applications and applets.

    <b>J.R.E.</b>(JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT):
    <p>
      The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is a software layer that runs on top of a computerâ€™s operating system software.
      It is a part of Java Development Kit and consists of Java Virtual Machine. It also provides the class libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.

  <li>
    <b>J.V.M.</b>(JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE):
    <p>
      It is an abstract machine.
      It consists of Just in time compiler and Byte Code can be executed line by line.
    </p>
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    <b>J.I.T.</b>(JUST IN TIME COMPILER):
    <p>
      The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is an essential part of the JRE i.e. Java Runtime Environment, that is responsible for performance optimization of java based applications at run time. The compiler is one of the key aspects in deciding the performance of an application for both parties i.e. the end-user and the application developer.
