  Byte Code is an intermediate language of Java.
  It is basically a computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary
  machine code so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor. The interpreter is
  typically implemented as a virtual machine (VM) that translates the byte code for the
  target platform.
