- Byte Code is an intermediate language of Java.
- It is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter. 
- This code cannot directly run on a system.
- We need interpreter to run this.
- It is basically a computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code.
- The interpreter is typically implemented as a virtual machine (VM) that translates the byte code into machine code for the target platform so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor.
- Byte code is saved in files with an extension of `.class`.
- Byte code can be executed on any operating system directly by a virtual machine, this makes Byte code and in turn Java, platform independent.
