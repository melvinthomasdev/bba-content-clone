    What is a Java?
  </h1>
  <p>
    The Java is one of the most widely used technology for the development of games
    mobile, web and desktop applications. Since the Java is platform independent, it
    works flawlessly on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc. The Java is very similar
    to C# and C++ so it is easier to switch between these languages.

    Brief History
  </h1>
  <p>
  The Java project was initiated in June 1991 by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and
  Patrick Naughton. Java was initially named Oak. It was later renamed Green and
  finally to Java. James Gosling designed Java with a syntax similar to C/C++. The
  first public version of Java was released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems. It could run
  on all the popular systems which caused Java to become popular quickly. With the
  release of Java 2 in December 1998, multiple configurations for different types of
  platforms were built.
