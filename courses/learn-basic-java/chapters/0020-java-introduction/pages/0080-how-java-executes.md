- The entire source code file, is translated by a compiler, not directly to machine code, but into something known as `Byte Code`.
- `Byte code` is an intermediate language of **Java**.
- The Byte code is saved in a file which has a suffix of `.class`.
- When you compile a `.java` file, it gives you a `.class` file.
- A file with extension `.java` is also called source file or Java file and a file with extension `.class` is called a Class file.
- Class file/Byte code can be translated on any operating system by an interpreter.
- This Class file, containing Byte Code, is then is translated line by line by an interpreter, Virtual Machine (V.M), into machine code(0s and 1s).
- A virtual machine is platform dependent, and so, every operating system has its own virtual machine package (Set of files you can download from the internet).
- The resulting instructions in Machine code can now be executed directly by the operating system.
