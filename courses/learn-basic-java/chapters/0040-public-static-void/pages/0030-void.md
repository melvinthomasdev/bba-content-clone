- **Void** is used at method declaration and definition to specify that the method does not return any type, the method returns void. 
- It is not a type and there is no void references/pointers as in C/C++.
- It's not instantiable as its only constructor is private.
- The only value we can assign to a Void variable is null.

## Example
<codeblock language="html" type="lesson">
  <code>
    public class Main{  
  		public static void main(String args[]){
  		}
  		public void add(){  
  			// this is a void method. It does not produce return value;
  		}
  	}
  </code>
</codeblock>
