- Java runtime environment is an installation package that provides an environment to only run the program. 
- This means we cannot create, modify or delete program or it's contents.
- It consists of :-

  * Deployment technologies.
  * User interface toolkits.
  * Integration libraries.
  * Base libraries
  * J.V.M

- After we get the `.class` file, the following executes during runtime :-
  
  * Class loader loads all classes needed to execute the program.
  * J.V.M sends code to byte code verifier to check the format of code. e.g :- Errors, Illegal practices.
