***JVM (Java Virtual Machine)*** is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).
- Java Virtual Machine sends Byte code to byte code verifier for checking the format of the code.
- It is used to convert Byte code line by line to executable code (0s and 1s).
- It consists of Just in time compiler.
- It also contains stack and heap memory allocations.
- JVM provides definitions for the:-

  * Memory area
  * Class file format
  * Register set
  * Garbage-collected heap
  * Fatal error reporting
