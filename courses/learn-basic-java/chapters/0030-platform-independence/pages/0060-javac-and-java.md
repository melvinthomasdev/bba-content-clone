# Javac
- javac (pronounced "java-see") is the primary Java compiler included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle Corporation.
- The javac tool accepts source code (class and interface definitions) conforming to the Java language specification (JLS) and compiles them into Java bytecode class files conforming to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).
- Following is the syntax of this command:

<codeblock language="java" type="lesson">
  <code>
    javac sample.java
  </code>
</codeblock>

# Java
- The java command is used to execute the bytecode of java. 
- It takes byte code as input and runs it and produces the output.

<codeblock language="java" type="lesson">
  <code>
    javac sample.java
  </code>
</codeblock>

## Let us consider an example, create a Sample Java program with name Sample.java
### Sample.java
<codeblock language="java" type="lesson">
  <code>
    public class Main {
      public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(
          "Hi, This is an example."
        );
      }
    }
  </code>
</codeblock>

If we compile this program using Javac command as shown below :-

```
  ➜  workspace > javac Sample.java
```
- This command compiles the given java file and generates a .class file (byte code).
  <img src="sample.png" alt="Sample" />
- If we execute the generated byte code (.class) file using the java command as shown below :-

```
 ➜  workspace > java Sample
Hi, This is an example.
```
This command executes the given .class file and produces the respective output.
