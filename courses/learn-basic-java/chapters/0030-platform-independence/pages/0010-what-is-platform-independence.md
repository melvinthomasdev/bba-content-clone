- Platform independence means the code can run on all systems.
- We need to convert source code into machine code so computer can understand.
- Compiler helps us in converting source code to executable code.
- Executable code is a set of instructions for the computer.
- Many languages compile the code into files which are platform dependent.
<br/>
For eg:
 After compiling C/C++ code we get `.exe` file which are platform dependent. If the code is compiled on a Macbook, the compiled file will not run on Windows/Linux or any other operating systems.
- In Java, the source code is compiled into <a href="java-introduction/byte-code">byte code</a>, this is then converted to machine code by J.V.M.
- Byte code can run on any operating system.
- This makes Java `platform independent`.
- However, while Java is platform independent. J.V.M. is platform dependent.
