React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes that need to be updated in the DOM. Browser APIs like `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName` are not recommended to be used as they break the abstraction that React provides.

This is one of the most common use cases for the `useRef` hooks.

The `useRef` hook is also used to persist values throughout the lifecycle of the component without using state variables.
