People often choose Redux before they need it. "What if our app doesnâ€™t scale
without it?" Later, developers frown at the indirection Redux introduced to
their code. "Why do I have to touch three files to get a simple feature
working?" Why indeed!

Instead learn to
[think in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html). Come back to
Redux if you find a real need for it.

## Handling Authentication

Handling authentication is the part where you might require a global state. You
can use [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)s in such
situations.
