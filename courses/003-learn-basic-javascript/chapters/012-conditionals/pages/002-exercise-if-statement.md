We have two variables, `number`  and `message`.

Use an `if` statement to check if the value of `number` is greater than `3`. If the condition is `true`, store the string `number is greater than 3` in the `message` variable.

<Editor type="exercise" lang="javascript">
<code>
let number = 4;
let message;

console.log(message);
</code>

<solution>
let number = 4;
let message;

if (number > 3) {
  message = "number is greater than 3";
}

console.log(message);
</solution>
