We use comments to describe
the working of our code to
**others**
and
**our future self**.
The comments are ignored
when the code executes.
Therefore,
they are not visible
in the output.


We can add **single-line comments**
using two forward-slash characters `//`.

In the example given below,
the comment fully
occupies the whole line.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
// This is a single line comment.
console.log("Hello World");
</code>
</Editor>

Anything to the right side of
`//` becomes a comment.

In the example given below,
only the text on the right side
of `//` is a comment.
The code on the
left side works normally.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
console.log("Hello World"); // This is also a single line comment.
</code>
</Editor>

The comments should be kept
precise and meaningful.
