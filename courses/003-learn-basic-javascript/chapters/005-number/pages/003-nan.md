In JavaScript,
`NaN` represents a value
which is **not a number**.

Sometimes,
we might perform arithmetic operations
on values which are not numbers.
In such cases,
the result is **Not a Number**
or
**NaN**.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
const personID = "123abc";
const product = personID * 2;
console.log(product);
</code>
</Editor>

In the example given below,
the value stored in
the `personID` variable contains
alphabets along with numbers.

This means that the value
of `personID` is not a proper number.
Therefore,
if we perform any arithmetic operations,
it returns `NaN`.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
const personID = "123abc";
const quotient = personID / 2;
console.log(quotient);
</code>
