We can use the letter `e`
to avoid writing long sequences of zeroes.
We can write **One thousand** as follows:

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
const oneThousand = 1e3;
console.log(oneThousand);
</code>
</Editor>

In the example given above,
the letter `e` is followed by `3`.
This is because,
**1000** has **three** zeroes in it.
