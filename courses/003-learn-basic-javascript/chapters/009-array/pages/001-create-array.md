An array is used to
store multiple values together.

Let us take an example
of a list of fruits:

| Fruit  |
| ------ |
| Apple  |
| Orange |
| Banana |

An array is built
by a pair of **square brackets**,
with items placed inside
it separated by commas.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"];

console.log(fruits);
</code>
