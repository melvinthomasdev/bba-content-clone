Let's see an example
where we are adding an element
at the end of the array: 

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
let vegetables = ["corn", "carrot", "potato"];
vegetables[3] = "beetroot";
console.log(vegetables);
</code>
</Editor>

Here, the last element in the `vegetables`
array has an index `2`.
To add an element at the end of the array,
we should add the new element
at index `3`.
