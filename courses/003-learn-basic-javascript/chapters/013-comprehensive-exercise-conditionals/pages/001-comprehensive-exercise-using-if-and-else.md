Follow the steps given below
to write a program:

1. Create a variable **num**
and store **9** in it.

2. Create an `if` statement
which checks if **num**
is exactly divisible by **3**.

3. In the `if` statement, display on the
console, **Number is divisible by 3** when
**num** is exactly divisible by **3**.

4. Use an `else` statement, to display on the
console, **Number is not a multiple of 3** when
**num** is not divisible by **3**.
