## Setting up Stripe account

Before understanding Stripe subscriptions we will first need to register for a
Stripe account. If we already have a verified account, we can skip this chapter.

First, we will need to [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) in the
Stripe dashboard. After registering successfully, make sure you are in the
`Test mode` as there are no fees of any kindâ€” from us, from Stripe, from
anybody. Now, we will edit our account name. Click on the `New Business`
dropdown and then click on the `Edit` button.

Enter the account name and save it successfully. Now, get your API keys by
clicking the `Developers` tab in the top right corner and checking in the
`API keys` section. We will use **Test API Keys** and then we will click on the
`Reveal test key` button.

Copy these API keys and save them for later use.
