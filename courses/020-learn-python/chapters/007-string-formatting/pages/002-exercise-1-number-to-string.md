Wall-E is a lost robot that has been found and repaired far in the future. However, Wall-E's startup line has been corrupted over the years.

Help reconstruct his initial startup sentence using `str()` given the data below. The program should print **Hi, My name is `name`. I was built in the year `year`. To give me a command say `command`.**

<code>
# Use the data below to print "Hi, My name is `name`. I was built in the year `year`. To give me a command say `command`."
# Use str() to join numbers to the sentence

name = "Wall-E"
year = 2008
command = "Hello Wall-E"
</code>

<solution>
# Use the data below to print "Hi, My name is `name`. I was built in the year `year`. To give me a command say `command`."
# Use str() to join numbers to the sentence

name = "Wall-E"
year = 2008
command = "Hello Wall-E"

print("Hi, My name is "+name+". I was built in the year "+str(year)+". To give me a command say "+command+".")
