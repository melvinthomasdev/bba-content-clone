Python provides an in-built way of storing key-value pairs. These are called **Dictionaries** and can be declared using `dict()` or `{}`.

<code>
fruits_and_colors = {
  "grapes": "green",
  "apple": "red",
  "banana": "yellow",
  "orange": "orange"
}

print(fruits_and_colors)

The keys here are the left-hand side strings i.e `grapes, apple, banana, orange.` They can be strings or numbers. The strings to the right are the values that are assigned to the keys.
