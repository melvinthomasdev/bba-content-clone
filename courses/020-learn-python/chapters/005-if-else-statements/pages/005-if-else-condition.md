The **If Else** condition can help us write a program which performs an alternate set of actions if the **if** condition is not satisfied. For example, if a shirt is a red, we print *This is a red shirt* else we print *This is not a red shirt*. We can handle such cases using the else statement.

<code>
shirt = "red"

if shirt == "red":
  print("This is a red shirt")
else:
  print("This is not a red shirt")
