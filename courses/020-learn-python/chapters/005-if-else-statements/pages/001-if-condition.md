The If condition is used when we want to execute statements only given condition is satisfied. It is declared by using the `if` keyword followed by a condition which will evaluate to a boolean of either `True` or `False`.

For example in the below program **if the signal is `green`** it prints **Go ahead**.
<Editor lang="python">
<code>
signal = "green"

if signal == "green":
  print("Go ahead")
</code>
</Editor>

Change the `signal` to the value "red" and see the result.
