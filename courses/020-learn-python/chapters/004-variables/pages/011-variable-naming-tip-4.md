##  Tip #4: Python variables are generally declared in snake case
Variables in Python are generally declared in snake case, which requires all the letters to be present in lower case and, words to be separated using underscores (`_`). This is not a rule, but a Python convention.

For example: A variable representing a list of animals can be named as `list_of_animals` or a variable representing the number of seasons in a show has can be named  as `number_of_seasons`.

<Editor lang="python">
<code>
no_of_animals = 13 # recommended
noOfAnimals = 13 # not recommended
</code>
