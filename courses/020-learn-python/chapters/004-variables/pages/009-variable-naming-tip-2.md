##  Tip #2: Variables names cannot start with a number.

Python, like many other languages does not support variables starting with a number. This is how the language is designed and having variables name start with a number can confuse the system during program execution.

<Editor lang="python">
<code>
oceans_12 = "movie" # valid variable name
13_reasons_why = "series" # not a valid variable
</code>
