Lists are dynamic and modifyable in nature. We can add and remove values from the list as and when required.

To add elements to a list we can use the `append()` method. The `append()` method will take in the value that has to be added and append it to the end of the list.

list_of_animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'sheep', 'horse']
print(list_of_animals)

list_of_animals.append('fox')
print(list_of_animals)
