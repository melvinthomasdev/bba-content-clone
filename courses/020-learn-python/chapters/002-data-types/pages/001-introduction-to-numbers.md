Python supports a couple of primary data types that are used commonly.

First among them are numbers i.e `1`, `2`, `3` ...

They are also known as **Integers** or `int` in Python. Python supports an infinite range of numbers.

You can run simple mathematical operations in Python using numbers and view the results.

To view the output of the operation we will use the `print` function call which is used to display messages on the screen. We will learn more on functions later in this course.
