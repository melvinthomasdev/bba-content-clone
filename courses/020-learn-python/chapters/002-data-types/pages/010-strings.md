A String in Python is text enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes ("). It can be a collection of alphabets, numbers, special charaters or any other symbol on the keyboard.

print("Hello world!")

We can join two strings using the `+` operator. Python will automatically recognize that both the operands are Strings and will concatenate them together.

<Editor lang="python">
<code>
print("Hello " + "Python!")
</code>
</Editor>


Python supports certain special formatting characters within Strings. These characters, known as **Escape Characters**, help in formatting and outputting text in a specific way. For example, we can use `\n` escape character to move to a new line, or use the `\t` escape character to order spaces between words.

<code>
print("My name is Python.\nI am a programming language.")
