SQL can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division or modulus.

**Modulus** is the remainder of a division between two numbers. It is
represented by the symbol **%**.

    Modulus  is sometimes also referred to as modulo.

Modulo is written as:

    4 % 2

For example when dividing numbers say
10 and 3,
results in a remainder of
1

<Editor lang="sql" dbName="clean-slate.db">
<code>
select 10 % 3;
</code>
</Editor>

While dividing numbers
7 and 4,
results in a remainder of
3

<Editor lang="sql" dbName="clean-slate.db">
<code>
select 7 % 4;
</code>
</Editor>
