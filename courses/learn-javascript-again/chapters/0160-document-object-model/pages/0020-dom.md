If we think about it,
how is a programming language
going to be able to access the
HTML elements?

The answer is the **DOM**,
the Document Object Model.

When the browser reads
an HTML element,
it converts the element
to its object representation.
The conversion takes place
through a series of steps.
And the browser does this
for all the elements
and
their children.

Look at the following code:

```javascript
<h1 id="title">This is not tough!</h1>
<p>It's really easy.</p>
```

This is how the browser sees it:

```javascript
h1 = {
  id: "title",
  innerText: "This is not tough!",
  tagName: 'H1'
}

p = {
  innerText: "It's really easy.",
  tagName: 'P'
}
```

There are more properties
that get associated
with each object.
This is only
a representation.
