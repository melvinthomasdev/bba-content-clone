Create a variable
`firstNumber` which
stores the value of
**3**.
Create another variable
`secondNumber` which
stores the value **5**.

Increase the value of
`firstNumber` by one.
Similarly, decrease the
value of `secondNumber`
by one.

Later check if `firstNumber`
and `secondNumber` are
equal or not, and log the
result to the console.

Output should be a Boolean.
