## Congrats on completing the book

First of all congratulations. You've come a long way and you've successfully
completed the book.

This chapter marks the end of our `granite` application and all of its features.

You must've learnt a lot of concepts via the process of building the
application.

## About the in depth chapters

We had set aside some content, which goes in-depth into certain Rails concepts.

The upcoming chapters deal with those concepts, and won't have anything to do
with the `granite` application.

Reading the in-depth chapters will solidify your current Rails knowledge, and
also will help you learn new advanced concepts.

Thus everyone should read the upcoming chapters too.

Happy reading and learning!
