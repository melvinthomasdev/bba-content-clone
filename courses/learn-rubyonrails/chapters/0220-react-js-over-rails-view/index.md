Using React.js over Rails view was a hard decision for us here at BigBinary.
[BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com) is a Ruby on Rails consulting company, and we
have been using Ruby on Rails for more than thirteen years.

Over the years we have seen the shift that more and more of our clients are
asking for React.js to be the view layer of their applications instead of Rails
view.

Today, more than 90% of the applications that we are building for our clients
use React.js. Therefore, we can't claim that this book is well maintained unless
we include lessons on integrating React to Rails application.

So, from hereon, we will be using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to write
frontend code. If you are a beginner to React and JavaScript, you can use the
materials mentioned in the below section to learn the fundamentals. We won't
recommend going into depth about React.js, given that this book is more oriented
towards Ruby on Rails.
