In side project task 2, we experimented with validations and the Rails console.
This task will be mainly dealing with controllers and actions.

## Task 3

- At this point, you should have a `Post` model and corresponding validations.
  Now add a posts controller with `index` action to list all the posts.
- Integrate React to your Rails app as outlined in the preceding chapters.
- Create a `Navbar`/`Sidebar` Component that will show us `nav items` like
  `posts` and `profile`.
- You can design a suitable UI in React to display the list of posts. A sample
  UI is given below. Each post should be in the form of a card component. Each
  card should display the title and a preview of the description. If the preview
  exceeds one line, it is recommended to truncate the excess description using
  an ellipsis to ensure a cleaner and more concise display.

as developing custom components from scratch can be a laborious and
time-consuming process.
