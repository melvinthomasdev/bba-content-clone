In side project task 3, we added a posts controller to display a list of posts.
This task will primarily involve creating posts and displaying them in detail on
an individual basis.

## Task 4

Let's incorporate the following functionalities into the application:

- Add frontend and backend capabilities to create a new post. The post creation
  form should allow users to submit the title and description of a potential
  blog-worthy idea. <image alt="Adding post">add-post.png</image>
- Once a user submits the form, the application should redirect to the post
  listing page and display the newly added post.
- When a user clicks on the post title from the listing page, a modal should
  appear, displaying the post's title and detailed description. It should be
  noted that the modal should show the description in its entirety using a
  scrollable interface.
