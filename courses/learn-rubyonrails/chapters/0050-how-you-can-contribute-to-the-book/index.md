## Help us to improve the book

In this book, our attempt is to keep things simple. If any part of the book is
confusing or something is missing then please send us an email at
`hello@BigBinary.com`.

We at BigBinary wrote this book because we wanted to have a book that contains
documentation about using both Rails and React in a simple step-by-step fashion,
that is easy to follow.

And that's what we have built in this book.

Your comments and suggestions are valuable to us. We are constantly working on
improving the book. Please do let us know your thoughts.

From BigBinary's side, we can promise that this book will forever be free and
publicly accessible.
