When you do a Google search, you are interacting with a client-server system. In this scenario, **the browser** that you're using to open up Google **is the client**. And when you enter a search term and press the "search" button, the client communicates with the server. The server then looks up what you need in its database and sends back the required data.

# Front-end vs. back-end

**Front-end** is the part of an application that is visible to you. For eg, in the Google search scenario, the iconic search page that you see is the front-end part of their application. It's what the user interacts with.

**Back-end** is the behind-the-scenes show runner. It takes care of operations or functionality of the application. In the Google search scenario, the back-end takes care of finding out pages that match your search term and send the list back to the client. The client then presents it to the user.

**A common analogy** for front-end and back-end systems involves restaurants. When you're at the restaurant, you interact with the waiter and makes an order. The waiter then communicates this order to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares the food according to the order. The waiter collects the food and brings it to you. Take a moment to think who plays the front-end and who plays the back-end roles in this scenario.

The waiter is the front-end and the kitchen is the back-end. Waiter interacts with the user and communicates with the kitchen. Kitchen prepares the food and communicates with the waiter.
