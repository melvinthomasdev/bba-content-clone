A web application or web app for short is a **computer program that can be accessed from a web browser to perform a  function or a set of functions**. Web apps are very common. Most of the popular sites you visit such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc fall under the category of web apps. Now you may wonder what the difference between a website and a web application is.

## Web application vs. website

Nowadays, it's hard to distinguish between a web app and a website. We could say that the difference between these two boils down to the interactivity with the user.

**A website** offers static content that's mostly the same to every person who accesses it. For eg, a news website. Most of the time, they show static content such as a news article. The main and most of the time the only interaction user has in a website is to navigate between pages.

Whereas, in **a web application**, the user plays a much bigger role. A web app can have a lot more interactive features than a website such as creating an account, setting up your profile, changing your preferences, performing operations, etc. An example of a web application is google.com. You are interacting with the website, to enter your search term and Google's servers run a search on that term to get you the results! That's interactivity!

But if you further take a look, you will realize that you can create an account on news websites or you can search for an article on the website. That also falls under interactivity. This poses a question on where to a draw a line between a website and a web app. But let's not get caught up in that. Let's focus on web applications in the coming chapters.
