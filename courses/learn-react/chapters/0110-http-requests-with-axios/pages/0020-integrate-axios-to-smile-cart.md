In this lesson, we will see how to fetch the product details using Axios in our SmileCart project.

We can utilize the following API endpoint to fetch the details of a product by its slug.

```plaintext
https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/:product_slug
```

Throughout this lesson, we will be using `infinix-inbook-2` as `product_slug`.

### Import Axios

Let's return to our `Product.jsx` component and import the Axios library.

```js
import axios from "axios";
```

### Create an async function

We will define an async function named `fetchProduct` that will be responsible for fetching product details from the API.

```js
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    "https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/infinix-inbook-2"
  );
  console.log("Api response", response);
};
```

`axios.get` function will send a `GET` request to the product details endpoint and return a Promise. We use the `await` keyword to pause the execution until this Promise is resolved or rejected. `fetchProduct` is declared as an async function to indicate that it involves asynchronous operations.

When you use Axios to make an HTTP request, the response is a JavaScript object having the following attributes:

- `data`: It's an object representing the actual server response data. Axios automatically deserializes the data if it is in `JSON` format.
- `status`: It's a number representing the status code returned by the server.
- `statusText`: It's a string representing the status message corresponding to the HTTP status code. For example, this would be `OK` for a status code `200`, `Continue` for `100`, `Not Found` for `404`.
- `headers`: It's an object that includes HTTP response header information like content type, caching, cookies, etc.
- `config`: It's an object containing the configuration options that were used to make the request. This includes properties like method, URL, headers, and other options.
- `request`: It's an `XMLHttpRequest` containing the HTTP request information.

### Initialize useEffect for initial data fetch

Now let's create a `useEffect` hook to trigger the `fetchProduct` function on the initial render of the product component.

```jsx
const Product = () => {
  const fetchProduct = async () => {
    ...
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, []);

  //rest of the code
};
```

As we have learned already, this `useEffect` hook will run only once, immediately after the component mounts because its dependency array is empty.
To view the API request getting triggered, open the `Network` tab of your browser's developer tools.

### Wrap async code in a try...catch block for error handling

To handle errors gracefully when dealing with asynchronous operations like API requests, we should wrap the code awaiting the promises in a `try/catch` block.

Here's how you can modify the `fetchProduct` to include the `try/catch` block:

```js
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/infinix-inbook-2"
    );
    console.log("Api response", response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error);
  }
};
```

To illustrate the importance of the `try/catch` block, let's consider a situation where an invalid URL is provided.

<codeblock language="javascript" type="lesson" packages="axios">
<code>
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://nonexistent-api.example.com/products/infinix-inbook-2"
    );
    console.log("Product name", response.data.name);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error);
  }
};

fetchProduct();

</code>
</codeblock>

In this example, error that occurs will be caught by the `try/catch` block, and we can log the error message to the console. However, if we don't use a `try/catch` block, and an error occurs during the execution, the error will not be caught and handled. It will lead to an `unhandled promise rejection` warning. Moreover, on attempting to access `response.data.name` it will result in a runtime error like `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')"`, because there is no valid response object to extract the data.

Remember, when working with asynchronous operations, using `try/catch` blocks is a best practice to ensure that your code handles errors effectively and maintains the stability of your application.

### Initialize state to store API response

To store the product data from the response in a state variable, you can use the `useState` hook. Letâ€™s create a state variable named `product` to hold this data.

```js
const [product, setProduct] = useState({});
```

To update the `product` state with the response `data`, you can modify the `fetchProduct` function as follows:

```js
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/infinix-inbook-2"
    );
    setProduct(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error);
  }
};
```

This is how data in the product state looks like:

```plaintext
{
    name: "Infinix INBOOK",
    slug: "infinix-inbook-2",
    available_quantity: 5,
    image_url: "https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/SmileCart/thumbnail_61_7PaLfb.jpg",
    mrp: 32678,
    offer_price: 30990,
    description:
      "Infinix Inbook X1 Ci3 10th 8GB 256GB 14 Win10 Grey - 1 Year Warranty.",
    image_urls: [
        "https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/SmileCart/1_yuRfcETI5.jpg",
        "https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/SmileCart/2_HoKD2OblW.png",
        "https://ik.imagekit.io/d9mvewbju/SmileCart/3_-6sHqwicC.png"
    ]
}
```

Now let's replace all the hardcoded product details present in the `Product.jsx` component with the data in the `product` state.

This can be accomplished by destructuring the essential properties from the product state. Furthermore, we will calculate the discount percentage for the product and store it in the variable `discountPercentage`.

Additionally, we should remove the `IMAGE_URLS` constant from the `src/constants.js` file.

```jsx {12-14, 22, 30-31, 33, 36}
const Product = () => {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState({});

  const fetchProduct = async () => {
    ...
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, []);

  const { name, description, mrp, offer_price } = product;
  const totalDiscounts = mrp - offer_price;
  const discountPercentage = ((totalDiscounts / mrp) * 100).toFixed(1);

  //...

  return (
    <div className="px-6 pb-6">
      <div>
        <Typography className="py-2 text-4xl font-semibold" style="h1">
          {name}
        </Typography>
        {/* rest of the code */}
      </div>

       {/* rest of the code */}

      <div className="w-3/5 space-y-4">
        <Typography>{description}</Typography>
        <Typography>MRP: {mrp}</Typography>
        <Typography className="font-semibold">
          Offer price: {offer_price}
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="font-semibold text-green-600">
          {discountPercentage}% off
        </Typography>
      </div>

      {/* rest of the code */}
    </div>
)};
```

> [toFixed()](https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/learn-javascript/number-methods/to-fixed) method rounds to a specified number of decimals.

Next, we will replace the hardcoded product image URLs passed to the `Carousel.jsx` component with the image URLs from the product APIs. To accomplish this, we need to extract two variables from the `product` state: `image_urls`, which contains a list of product image URLs, and `image_url`, which contains the URL of the default product image. We will then use the `append` function from `ramda.js` to append the `image_urls` and `image_url` together. Finally, we will pass the combined URLs as a prop to the `Carousel.jsx` component.

```jsx {1, 7-8, 16, 18-20, 22}
import { append } from "ramda";
// ...

const Product = () => {
  // ...

  const { name, description, mrp, offer_price, image_urls, image_url } =
    product;

  // ...

  return (
    <>
      {/* rest of the code */}

      <div className="mt-16 flex gap-4">
        <div className="w-2/5">
          <div className="flex justify-center gap-16">
            <Carousel imageUrls={append(image_url, image_urls)} title={name} />
          </div>
        </div>
      <div>

        {/* rest of the code */}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

We need to render the `Carousel` component only if the `image_urls` is not null. Otherwise, we will show the default product image. We can use the `isNotNil` function from `ramda.js` to conditionally render the `Carousel` component.

```jsx {1, 12-16}
import { isNotNil, append } from "ramda";
// ...

const Product = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <>
      {/* rest of the code */}

      <div className="flex justify-center gap-16">
        {isNotNil(image_urls) ? (
          <Carousel imageUrls={append(image_url, image_urls)} title={name} />
        ) : (
          <img alt={name} className="w-48" src={image_url} />
        )}

        {/* rest of the code */}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

In JavaScript, it's a best practice to use `camelCase` for naming variables to maintain consistency and readability. However, when dealing with API responses where the keys are typically in `snake_case`, it's often necessary to reassign them to `camelCase`.

```js
const {
  name,
  description,
  mrp,
  offer_price: offerPrice,
  image_urls: imageUrls,
  image_url: imageUrl,
} = product;
```

At this point, you may see empty content on the product page as shown below for a brief amount of time:

<image>product-page-with-no-loader.png</image>

This happens because the product data is empty when React renders the component for the first time. The component can render correctly only after receiving a proper API response from the server.

To overcome such issues it's a good practice to include a loading indicator while data is being fetched. This prevents the user from interacting with an incompletely rendered UI.

To achieve this, we will create a new state variable named `isLoading`.

```jsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
```

The initial value of `isLoading` is set to `true`, indicating that the product component is in the loading state initially. Regardless of whether the API call succeeds or encounters an error, the `isLoading` state needs to be set to `false` to indicate the completion of the API request. To ensure this, we have called the `setIsLoading` function inside the `finally` block.

```js
const fetchProduct = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/infinix-inbook-2"
    );
    setProduct(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred:", error);
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

Let's implement a loader in the product component to indicate to the user that data is being fetched. We will utilize the `isLoading` state to dynamically display the loader.
To achieve this, we can use the [Spinner](https://neeto-ui.neeto.com/?path=/docs/components-spinner--default) component from `neetoUI` library.

```jsx {26-32}
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

import { Spinner } from "neetoui";

const Product = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const [product, setProduct] = useState({});

  const fetchProduct = async () => {
    try {
      //Product API
    } catch (error) {
      //Handle error
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, []);

  //destructing product
  //discount percentage calculations

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex h-screen w-full items-center justify-center">
        <Spinner />
      </div>
    );
  }

  //rest of the code
};

export default Product;
```

By following these steps, you've successfully updated the product component to show product details through an API. Users will see a loader while the data is being fetched, and once the data is available, the spinner will be replaced with the actual product information.

Here's how the modified product page looks.

git add -A
git commit -m "Integrated API to display product details"
