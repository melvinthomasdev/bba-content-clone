React components go through a lifecycle consisting of three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. React allows us to monitor and perform specific actions during these phases. This helps us to manage the component's behavior and interactions with the DOM.

**Mounting:** The Mounting phase is the initial phase of a component's lifecycle. It occurs when a component is created and inserted into the DOM for the first time.

**Updating:** The Updating phase occurs when a component receives new props or updates its state, causing the component to re-render. This phase is essential for reflecting changes in the user interface.

**Unmounting:** This is the third and final phase of a component's lifecycle. It occurs when a component is removed from the DOM.

To understand the concept of component lifecycle, letâ€™s look at an example where we are conditionally rendering the `Counter` component within the `App` component based on the `isCounterVisible` state variable. Clicking the `Mount Counter` button toggles `isCounterVisible`, displaying the `Counter` component if it's `true`. Users can increase the count with the `Increase count` button. Clicking `Unmount Counter` removes it from the DOM tree.

<codeblock language="reactjs" type="lesson" packages="tailwindcss">
<code>
import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [isCounterVisible, setIsCounterVisible] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => setIsCounterVisible(isCounterVisible => !isCounterVisible);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <button
        className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 mt-4 rounded"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        {isCounterVisible ? "Unmount Counter" : "Mount Counter"}
      </button>
      {isCounterVisible && <Counter />}
    </div>
  );
};

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);

  return (
    <div className="text-center mt-2 pt-6 border rounded-md shadow-lg">
      <p className="text-lg font-bold">Count = {count}</p>
      <button
        className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-1 px-2 mt-2 rounded"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        Increase count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
</code>
</codeblock>

- When the `isCounterVisible` toggles to `true`, the `Counter` component renders for the first time or gets inserted into the DOM. This represents the mounting phase.

- When we click on the `Increase count` button, the state updates and React re-renders the Counter component. This represents the updating phase.

- Clicking on the `Unmount Counter` button sets the `isCounterVisible` state to `false`. This results in the removal of the Counter component from the DOM. This represents the unmounting phase.

In the next lesson, we will learn about one of the powerful hooks in React, `useEffect` which lets us perform specific actions during these phases in the component lifecycle.
