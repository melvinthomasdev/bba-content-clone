Welcome to BigBinary Academy!

To learn to program in React, we expect you to have the fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to go through the following courses if you are not familiar with these technologies.

- [HTML](https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/learn-html)

We expect that you are familiar with the new JavaScript features introduced in ES6 (ECMA Script 2015) or later, such as classes, arrow functions, array methods, destructuring, etc.

It is highly recommended to have a personal computer equipped with a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a browser,`Node.js` and `npm` installed for local development.
