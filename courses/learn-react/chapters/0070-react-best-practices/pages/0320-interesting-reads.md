## Debounce and throttling

**Debouncing** enforces that a function not be called again until a certain
amount of time has passed without it being called. As in "execute this function
only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called."

**Throttling** enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over
time. As in "execute this function at most once every 100 milliseconds."
