In Git, we can ignore certain files or directories by using a `.gitignore` file. This is useful when we have files that we don't want to track or include in our repository, like log files or personal configurations. Let's see how we can ignore files in Git:

_Step 1_: Create a `.gitignore` file: We start by creating a file named `.gitignore` in our project's root directory.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

_Step 2_: Specify ignored files: Inside this file, we list the files or directories we want to ignore. For example, to ignore a file named `log.txt`, we simply add `log.txt` to our `.gitignore`. If a file is in a directory, we can specify the directory and file name, like `logs/log.txt`.

_Step 3_: Save and commit: After saving our `.gitignore`, we commit it to our repository. Now, Git will ignore the specified files in future commits.
