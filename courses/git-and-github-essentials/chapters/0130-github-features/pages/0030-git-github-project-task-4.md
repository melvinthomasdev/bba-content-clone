In the side project task 3, you created a branch named `add-readme` and pushed it to the remote repository. Now, let's move on to the next task.

## Task 4

In this task, you'll create an issue and a pull request for the `add-readme` branch.

1. Create an issue in your `personal-blog` repository. The issue should be titled "Add README file".
2. Create a pull request for the `add-readme` branch. The pull request should be titled "Added README file".

Note: If you have recently pushed the `add-readme` branch to the remote repository, GitHub will automatically suggest opening a pull request for that branch. You can follow the steps mentioned in the previous chapter to open a pull request.
