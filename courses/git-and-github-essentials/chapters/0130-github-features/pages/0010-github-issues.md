Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for our projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of our team. We can assign issues to specific people, label them for easy searching, and reference other issues and pull requests. For example, if we find a bug in our code, we can open an issue detailing the problem, and then assign it to the person best suited to fix it.

Here are the steps to create an issue on GitHub:

**Step 1:** Navigate to the repository where we want to create an issue. The repository link is usually in the format `www.github.com/<username>/<repository-name>`.

**Step 2:** Click on the `Issues` tab.
