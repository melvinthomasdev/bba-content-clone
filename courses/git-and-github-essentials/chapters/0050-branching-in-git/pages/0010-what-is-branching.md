Branching in Git is a powerful feature that allows us to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work independently without affecting the main project. It's like creating a parallel universe where we can experiment, develop features, or fix bugs without disturbing the original codebase.

A branch in Git is essentially a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When we create a branch, we're making a copy of the code at that point in time, on which we can then work separately.

Branches are used to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. This way, the main branch remains stable, and our changes can be tested and completed before being merged back.

Lets look at some common branching operations in Git in the next few pages.
