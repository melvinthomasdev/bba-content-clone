Creating a new repository on GitHub is a straightforward process:

After logging into GitHub, visit the repository page, which is usually located here: `www.github.com/<username>?tab=repositories`. On this page, we click on the 'New' button on the top right corner.

This will take us to the 'Create a new repository' page. Here, we can fill in the repository details:

**Repository Name**: This is the name of our repository. It should be unique and descriptive.
**Description**: A brief description of our repository. This helps others understand what our project is about. It's optional, but it's good practice to provide one.

**Visibility**: We can choose between these visibility options for our repository:

- **Public**: Anyone can see our repository, and it's accessible to everyone. This is useful for open-source projects.
- **Private**: Only collaborators can see our repository. This is useful for projects that are not ready to be shared publicly.

**Initialize this repository with**: We can choose to initialize our repository with a README file, a `.gitignore` file, and a license. This is useful for starting a new project with some initial files. Don't worry if you're not sure about these options, you can always add them later.

After filling in the details, we click on the `Create repository` button. Our new repository is now created on GitHub!
