Let's begin working a project where you will create a remote repository on GitHub for your personal blog. There will be no assessment for this project. Instead, it will guide you on how to build it yourself. This way, you'll learn more about Git and GitHub. You'll work on this project while you're learning from the course. This will help you understand and remember the things you learn better.

## Task 1

Create a remote repository on GitHub with the following details:

- **Repository Name**: `personal-blog`
- **Description**: `Source code for my personal blog`
- **Visibility**: `Private`

**Important**: Do not initialize the repository with a README file, a `.gitignore` file, or a license at this stage. These files will be added later in the project. This step is crucial to avoid confusion with the `README.md` file that you will be creating and adding to your repository in a later task.

Once you've created the repository, you'll see the repository page with the README file. This is the remote repository where you'll push your local changes.
