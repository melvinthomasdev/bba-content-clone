In Git, staging files means preparing them for a commit. Consider it like placing items into a package that's prepared for delivery. Let's look at how we can stage changes in Git.

1. Identify Changes: We start by making changes to our files. These modifications are initially "unstaged".

2. Stage Changes: To stage our changes, we use the command `git add`. Let's look at some examples to understand this better.

- To stage specific files, we list the filenames after `git add`. For example, to stage the `index.html` file, we run:

```bash
git add index.html
```

- To stage all changes in the current directory, we use `git add .`. For example, to stage all changes in the current directory, we run:

```bash
git add .
```

- To stage all changes in the repository, including files in subdirectories, we use `git add --all` or `git add -A`. For example, to stage all changes in the repository, we run:

```bash
git add -A
```

Staging allows us to control exactly which changes we want to commit, making our commits cleaner and more manageable.
