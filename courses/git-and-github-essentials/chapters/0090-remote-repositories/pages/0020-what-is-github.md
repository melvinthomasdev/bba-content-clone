GitHub is a platform where we can store our code online using Git. It's like a social network for developers, allowing us to collaborate on projects.

We can create repositories to hold our projects, make changes, and then push those changes for others to see and contribute. For example, if we're building a website, we can store all our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on GitHub.

It's also a great place to work on open-source projects and contribute to the wider developer community. With GitHub, our code is always accessible and safe.

If you haven't already, you can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup).
