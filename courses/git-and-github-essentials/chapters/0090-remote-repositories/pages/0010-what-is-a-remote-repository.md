In Git, a remote repository is a version of our project hosted on the internet or network. It allows us to collaborate with other team members easily.

For example, if we're working on a project with a team, we would have a remote repository on a service like GitHub. We can push our changes to this remote repository, and our team members can pull those changes to their local machines.

So, a remote repository is essentially a bridge that connects our local repository to others, enabling collaborative work.
