Git merge is a command that allows us to integrate changes from one branch into another. Here's a simple example of how to merge changes.

Let's consider two feature branches: `feature-login` and `feature-signup`. We've made changes in both branches and want to merge them into the `main` branch.

**Pull Request**: We start by creating a pull request to merge `feature-login` into `main`. This allows our team to review the changes before they're merged.

**Merge**: After the pull request is reviewed and approved, we merge `feature-login` into `main`. Now, all the changes we made in `feature-login` are in the `main` branch.

**Update Feature Branch**: Next, we want to make sure `feature-signup` has the latest changes from `main`. So, we merge `main` into `feature-signup` using the `git merge` command.

```bash
git checkout feature-signup
git merge main
```

**Result**: Now, `feature-signup` has all the changes from `main`, including the changes we originally made in `feature-login`. This ensures that when we're working on `feature-signup`, we're doing so with the most up-to-date code.

In this way, we can keep our feature branches updated and ensure smooth integration of changes.
