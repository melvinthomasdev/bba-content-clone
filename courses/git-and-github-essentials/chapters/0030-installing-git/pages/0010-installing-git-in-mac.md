Installing Git on a Mac is pretty straightforward. We will explore two ways to install Git on a Mac.

## Using Xcode Command Line Tools

Xcode Command Line Tools is a set of tools provided by Apple for developing software on macOS. We can check if Git is already installed on our Mac by running the following command in the Terminal.

```bash
git --version
```

This command will prompt us to install Xcode Command Line Tools if it is not already installed. We follow the on-screen instructions to install it, which includes Git.

## Using Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS and we can use it to install Git. We can install git using Homebrew by running the following command in the Terminal.

```bash
brew install git
```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify that Git has been installed successfully, we can run the following command in the Terminal.

```bash
git --version
```

This command will display the version of Git installed on our Mac.
