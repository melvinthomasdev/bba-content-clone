To allow access to collaborators on GitHub, we follow these steps:

**Navigate to Repository**: We start by going to the main page of our repository. This is where we can see all the files and settings related to our project.

**Access Settings**: Under our repository name, we find the "Settings" tab and click on it. This takes us to the settings page for our repository.

**Manage Access**: On the settings page, we find the "Access" option on the left side menu and click on it. This is where we can manage who has access to our repository.

**Invite Collaborator**: We click on the green "Add people" button and enter the username, full name, or email address of the person we want to invite. We then click "Add <username> to <repository>" button to send the invitation.

**Confirm Invitation**: The person we invited will receive an email with the invitation. Once they accept it, they'll have access to our repository.

By following these steps, we can invite others to collaborate on our projects and manage who has access to our code.
