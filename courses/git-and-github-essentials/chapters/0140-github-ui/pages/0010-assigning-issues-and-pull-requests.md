To assign an issue or pull request on GitHub, follow these steps:

**Access Issues or Pull Requests**: Under our repository name, we find options for "Issues" and "Pull requests". We click on the one that's relevant to us. If we want to assign someone to work on a problem, we click "Issues". If we want to assign someone to review code changes, we click "Pull requests".

**Select Issue or Pull Request**: We're now presented with a list of issues or pull requests. We open the one we want to assign to someone.

**Assign**: On the right side of the issue or pull request page, we find the "Assignees" section. We click on it, start typing the username of the person we want to assign, and click their name when it appears.

**Confirm Assignment**: The selected person is now assigned to the issue or pull request. We can assign up to ten people to each issue or pull request.

By assigning issues and pull requests, we can clearly communicate who is responsible for what within our project. This helps keep our project organized and ensures everyone knows what they should be working on.
