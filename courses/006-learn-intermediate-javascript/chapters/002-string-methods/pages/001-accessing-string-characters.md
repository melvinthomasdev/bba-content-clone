We can access any character from a string by using its position in the string.
We use square brackets `[]` for this.
The position count starts from **0**.
Since, **S** is at position **0** in the string `name` and can be accessed thus: `name[0]`.

<code>
let name = "Sam";
let firstCharacter = name[0];
console.log(firstCharacter);
