We can use the `charAt` method
to get the character at a particular position
in the string.

The first character is at position zero.

In the example given below,
we are accessing the second character of the string.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
let userName = "Sam Smith";
console.log(userName.charAt(1));
</code>
</Editor>
