Let's take a look at
the code given below.
It helps us find the
largest number from
a group of numbers.

<Editor lang="javascript">
<code>
let maxNum = Math.max(1, 2, 3, 50, 12);
console.log(maxNum);
</code>
</Editor>

Some mathematical calculations
are extremely useful in many
circumstances. For example,
finding the largest number
from a group of numbers, etc.

To avoid repeating the same code,
it makes sense that we have a
standard set of functions that
we can use in these situations.

In JavaScript, this role
is performed by the `Math`
object. It contains mathematical
methods and constants which are
extremely useful in our work,
like the `Math.max()` method.
